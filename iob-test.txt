further O
analysis O
even O
suggested O
that O

recognizes O

more O
efficiently O
than O
sars-cov B-COVID
increasing O
the O
ability O

thus O
, O
the O

also O
have O

this O
similarity O

is O
critical O
because O

, O
this O

for O

we O
therefore O
previously O

that O

a O
key O
question O
is O
why O
the O

to O
be O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
target O
organ O

one O
reason O
is O
that O
the O

the O

a O
biological O
factor O

may O

several O
limitations O
of O
the O
present O
study O
exist O

first O
, O
the O
dataset O
relies O
on O
publicly O
available O
information O
that O
is O
not O
uniformly_distributed O
( O
i.e. O
, O
collected O
from O
various O
sources O
) O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
availability O
of O
dates O
relevant O
to O
our O
analyses O
is O
limited O
to O
a O
small O
, O
selective O
sample O
that O
is O
not O
necessarily O
generalizable O
to O
all O
confirmed_cases B-COVID

moreover O
, O
given O
the O
novelty O
of O
the O
covid-19 B-COVID
pneumonia B-COVID
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
illness_onset O
and O
other O
event O
data O
were O
handled O
differently O
between O
jurisdictions O
( O
e.g. O
, O
was O
illness_onset O
the O
date O
of O
fever B-COVID
or O
date O
of O
dyspnea B-COVID
? O
) O

second O
, O
our O
data O
include O
very O
coarse O
date O
intervals O
with O
some O
proxy O
dates O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
left O
and/or O
right O
hand O
dates O
of O
some O
intervals O

third O
, O
as O
the O
sample_size O
was O
limited O
, O
the O
variance O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
biased O

fourth O
, O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
examine O
the O
heterogeneity O
of O
estimates O
by O
different O
attributes O
of O
cases O
( O
e.g. O
, O
severity O
of O
disease O
) O

lastly O
, O
as O
we O
only O
have O
information O
on O
confirmed_cases B-COVID
, O
there O
is O
a O
bias O
towards O
more O
severe_disease-particularly O
for O
earlier O
cases O

this O

presents O
the O
estimates O
of O
epidemiological O

that O

we O
found O
that O
the O

should O
be O
at O

14 O

, O
and O
we O
stress O
that O
the O
17 O
- O
24-day O
time O
delay O
from O

must O
be O
addressed O
when O

a O

factors O
that O
resulted O

in O
2002 O

2003 O
, O
the O
outbreak O
of O
sars O
brought O
a O
disaster O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the O
world O
, O
especially O
the O
chinese O
people O

fortunately O
, O
sars O
was O
finally O
defeated O
, O
and O
chinese O
health O
departments O
upgraded O
their O
disease O
prevention O
and O
control O
system O
by O
summing O
up O
their O
experiences O
of O
fighting O
sars O

thus O
, O
when O
covid-19 B-COVID
appeared O
, O
the O
whole O

quickly O
entered O
a O
state O
of O
fighting O
against O
the O

policies O
led O

the O

have O
been O

efficiently O
, O
and O
chinese O
scientists O
identified O
the O
etiology O
of O
the O

in O
no O
more O
than O
a O
month O

however O
, O
new O
cases O
are O
increasing O
every O

, O
showing O
a O
trend O
of O
spreading O
to O
the O
whole O
country O
and O
across O
the O
world O

covid-19 B-COVID
appeared O
just O
one O
month O
before O
the O
spring_festival O
of O
china O
, O
and O
the O
massive O
population O
flow O
has O
brought O
great O
challenges O
for O
disease O
prevention O
and O
control O

this O
virus O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
human O
to O
human O
and O
no O
effective O
treatment O
drug O
has O
been O
found O

the O
most O
effective O
prevention O
and O
control_measures O
are O
to O
find O
suspected O
patients O
and O
close_contacts O
, O
confirm O
patients O
and O
virus O
carriers O
, O
and O
block O
the O
transmission O
through O

, O
disinfection O
, O
and O
personal_protection O

therefore O
, O
early O
detection O
, O
isolation O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
patients O
are O
the O
key O
measures O
to O
control O
the O
source O
of O
infection B-COVID
and O
reduce O
the O
infection B-COVID
rate O

it O
is O
also O
crucial O
to O
avoid O
nosocomial_infection O
by O
strengthening O
the O
management O
of O
medical O
staff O
and O
patients O

health O
education O
on O
knowledge O
for O
disease O
prevention O

is O
also O
important O

finally O

if O
we O
want O
to O
eliminate O
the O
threat O
of O
this O
novel O

pneumonia B-COVID
similar O

, O
we O

another O
confusion O
is O
, O
when O

, O
everyone O

do O
to O

is O

any O

these O
questions O
takes O

there O
is O
no O

to O
wait O

all O
these O
questions O
are O
resolved O
before O

we O
can O
take O
actions O
to O
prevent O
covid-19 B-COVID
immediately O
while O
waiting O
for O
answers O
to O
these O
questions O

this O
is O
because O
we O
have O
the O
evidence-based O
strategy O
for O
control O
and O
prevention O
of O
any O
infectious_disease O
without O
complete O
understanding O

that O
is O
so-called O
tri-component O

the O

of O

, O

and O
blocking O
the O

paths O
, O
and O
protecting O
those O
who O
are O
susceptible O

this O
was O
just O
what O

done O
, O

doing O
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
do O

typical O

which O

also O
apply O

a O
good O
example O
is O
the O

whereas O
the O

the O

in O
the O

has O
a O

and O
has O
so O

resulted O
in O
only O
a O

another O
example O

that O

in O
the O
case O
of O

, O
there O
have O
been O
some O

that O
, O
sometimes O
, O
an O
individual O
with O
highly O
severe O
2019-ncov B-COVID

will O
only O
cause O
a O

, O
conversely O
, O
individuals O

can O
occasionally O
cause O

, O
though O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O

a O
possible O
consequence O
of O
this O
is O
that O
viral O

that O

whether O
the O

the O

based O
on O

, O
the O
current O
2019-ncov B-COVID
seems O
to O
have O

however O
, O
more O

however O
, O
the O

several O

here O

since O

the O
model O
of O
sars-cov-2 O
transmission O
, O
similar O
to O
nipah_virus O
, O
is O
that O
farms O
are O
built O
around O
bat B-WILDLIFE
habitats O
, O
causing O
bats B-WILDLIFE
to O
pass O
the O
virus O
to O
animals O
through O
saliva O
, O
urine O
, O
and O
feces O

at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
because O
zhejiang O
is O
a O
natural_habitat O
for O
bamboo O
rats O
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
some O
farms O
directly O
introduced O
wild O
bamboo O
rats O
, O
which O
were O
already O
infected O
with O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
virus O

for O
the O
above O
reasons O
, O
the O
bamboo O
rats O
carrying O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
virus O
were O
transported O
from O
the O
infected O
place O
to O
the O
incident O
site O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
civets O
spread O
sars-cov O

the O
second O
site O
is O
wuhan O
, O
the O
place O
of O
the O
sars-cov-2 O
outbreak O
, O
and O
it O
is O
also O
the O
end_point O
for O
some O
bat B-WILDLIFE
migration O

zhengli O
shi O
's O
team O
from O
wuhan O
institute O
of O
virology O
, O
chinese O
academy O
of O
sciences O
, O
isolated O
a O
live O
sars-like O
strain O
in O
the O
feces O
of O
horseshoe_bats O

this O
suggests O
that O
the O
way O
the O
bats B-WILDLIFE
spread O
the O
virus O
is O
not O
only O
via O
direct_contact O
, O
but O
also O
through O
feces O

therefore O
, O
when O
bats B-WILDLIFE
carrying O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
virus O
forage O
at O
huanan_seafood_market O
, O
they O
may O
pass O
the O
virus O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
to O
intermediate_hosts O

however O
, O
to O
confirm O
this O
scenario O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
find O
wild O
bats B-WILDLIFE
in O
wuhan O
and O
its O
neighboring O
areas O
that O
carry O
covs O
identical O
to O
those O
isolated O
from O
various O
sars-2 B-COVID
patients O

it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
find O
a O
mechanism O
for O
the O
very O
quick O
outbreak O
in O
such O
a O
wide O
area O
by O
a O
natural O
source O
of O
sars-cov-2 O

epidemiological O
investigations O
showed O
that O
13 O
of O
the O
first O
41 O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
huanan_seafood_market O

another O
survey O
of O
sars-2 B-COVID
found O
that O
no O
bats B-WILDLIFE
were O
on O
sale O
in O
huanan_seafood_market O

with O
so O
many O
bats B-WILDLIFE
concentrated O
into O
a O
local O
area O
, O
the O
spreading O
of O
viruses O
by O
bats B-WILDLIFE
might O
be O
much O
wider O
than O
just O
being O
restricted O
to O
one O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
trading O
place O
such O
as O
the O
huanan_seafood_market O

the O
viruses O
might O
have O
lived O
in O
this O
big O
` O
` O
incubation B-COVID
bed O
'' O
for O
some O
time O
and O
achieved O
some O
mutations O
before O
jumping O
on O
to O
the O
final O
hosts-human O
beings O

a O
study O
on O
horseshoe_bats O
in O
hong_kong O
and O
guangdong O
showed O
that O
the O
viruses O
carried O
by O
horseshoe_bats O
in O
these O
two O
places O
are O
different O

however O
, O
some O
horseshoe_bats O
were O
found O
to O
carry O
two O
viruses O
after O
mating O
and O
foraging O
activity O

this O
indicates O
that O
horseshoe_bats O
not O
only O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
migrate O
, O
but O
also O
the O
ability O
to O
promote O
the O
spread O
of O
virus O
within O
the O
same O
roost O
and O
from O
roost O
to O
roost O

in O
addition O
, O
sequencing O
the O
entire O
genome O
of O
virus O
carried O
by O
bats B-WILDLIFE
in O
multiple O
regions O
revealed O
frequent O
recombination O
among O
different O
strains O

for O
example O
, O
civet O
sarsr-cov O
sz3 O
recombination O
was O
detected O
between O
sarsr-rh-batcov O
rp3 O
from O
guangxi O
, O
china O
, O
and O
rf1 O
from O
hubei O
, O
china O

therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
spread O
from O
zhoushan O
to O
wuhan O
due O
to O
bat B-WILDLIFE
migration O

it O
turned O
out O
that O
bats B-WILDLIFE
are O
not O
only O
attracted O
by O
green O
lights O
but O
also O
red O
lights O

along O
the O
yangtze_river O
there O
are O
also O
huge O
bridges O
decorated O
with O
a O
massive O
number O
of O
red O
lights O

thus O
, O
bats B-WILDLIFE
migrating O
along O
the O
yangtze_river O
might O
be O
attracted O
by O
these O
red O
lights O
and O
be O
relocated O
nearby O

wuhan O
might O
be O
a O
new O
habitation O
site O
for O
a O
massive O
number O
of O
bats B-WILDLIFE

these O
bats B-WILDLIFE
, O
coming O
from O
different O
locations O
, O
might O
carry O
different O
virus O
strains O

separate O
evolution O
and O
the O
recombination O
of O
these O
viruses O
might O
lead O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
various O
sars-covs O
capable O
of O
cross-species_transmission O
and O
ultimate O
infection B-COVID
of O
human O

many O
observations O
have O
shown O
the O
outbreak O
of O
sars-2 B-COVID
actually O
started O
from O
multiple O

, O
instead O
of O
just O
a O

of O

within O
wuhan O
, O
surrounding O
wuhan O
, O
and O
remote O
from O
wuhan O
, O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
incidences O
of O
sars-2 B-COVID
have O
some O
distinct O
patterns O

although O
the O
remotely O

can O
be O

, O
some O
wuhan O
cases O
and O
the O

in O

still O
lack O
reliable O

amazingly O
, O
most O
of O
the O

can O
be O
traced O
to O
a O

, O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID

how O
could O
this O

quickly O
infect O
so O
many O
people O
in O

this O
is O
a O
question O
that O

in O

although O
the O

, O
the O

the O

, O
the O

it O

our O

has O
some O
limitations O

firstly O
, O
the O
seir_model O
was O
set O
up O
based O
on O
a O
number O
of O
necessary O
assumptions O

for O
example O
, O
we O
assumed O
that O
no O
super-spreaders O
exist O
in O
the O
model O
, O
but O
there O
is O
currently O
no O
supportive O
evidence O

secondly O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
estimation O
model O
depends O
largely O
on O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
parameters O
it O
used O
, O
such O
as O

with O
more O
precise O
parameters O
obtained O
as O
the O
epidemic O
progresses O
, O
our O
estimation O
model O
will O
also O
be O
more O
precise O

our O
estimates O
of O
the O
reproductive_number O
from O
3.1 O
to O
0.5 O
are O
based O
on O
previous_studies O
and O

however O
, O
this O
measure O
may O
change O
substantially O
over O
the O
course O
of O
this O
epidemic O
and O
as O
additional O
data O
arrives O

besides O
, O
using O
a O
fixed O
r O
t B-WILDLIFE
value O
in O
each O
phase O
may O
incur O
potential O
bias O
because O
r O
t B-WILDLIFE
is O
essentially O
a O
dynamic O
parameter O

thirdly O
, O
these O
estimated O
data O
may O
not O
be O
sustained O
if O
unforeseeable O
factors O
occurred O

for O
example O
, O
if O
some O
infections O
were O
caused O
by O
multiple O
exposures O
to O
animals O
, O
these O
estimates O
will O
be O
exposed O
to O
a O
big O
uncertainty O

fourthly O
, O
the O
epidemic O
trend O
shows O
great O
difference O
between O
wuhan O
and O
hubei_province B-COVID
and O
regions O
in O
mainland_china B-COVID
outside O
hubei_province B-COVID
according O
to O
the O
nhc O
reported O

it O
is O
thus O
inappropriate O
to O
generalize O
the O
estimations O
in O

to O

the O

the O
other O

in O
mainland_china B-COVID
remains O
to O

this O
is O
not O

detected O
infection B-COVID

and O
death O
, O
and O
that O

of O

, O
none O

although O
we O
have O
previously O
found O
mers-cov B-COVID
circulating O
in O

from O
this O
region O

it O
is O
possible O
that O
herders O
are O
at O
lower O
risk O
than O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
because O
camels O
brought O
to O
slaughterhouses O
often O
transit O
via O
camel O
markets O
where O
mixing O
of O
camels O
from O
diverse O
sources O
allows O
for O
amplification O
of O
virus O
circulation O
which O
may O
result O
in O
higher O
rates O
of O
virus O
shedding O
and O
greater O
mers-cov B-COVID
exposure O
of O
these O
slaughterhouse O
workers O

in O
the O

, O
the O
ppnt O

were O
1:40 O
and O
prnt O

were O

this O
is O
not O
unexpected O
as O
even O
patients O
with O

do O
not O
invariably O
mount O
robust O
neutralising O
or O
elisa O

unless O
they O

thus O
, O
people O
with O
mild O

may O
have O
low O
or O
undetectable O
antibody O

to O
mers-cov B-COVID
, O
and O
furthermore O
, O
such O

may O
wane O

considerably O

'' O
` O

it O

the O
wide O
range O
and O
the O
variability O
in O
r0 O
values O
reported O
by O
different O
studies O
indicate O
that O
precisely O
estimating O
r0 O
is O
quite O
challenging O
, O
because O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
calculate O
the O
exact O
number O
of O
infected O
cases O
during O
an O
epidemic O

otherwise O
, O
the O
r0 O
value O
is O
affected O
by O
environmental O
circumstances O
, O
demography O
, O
statistical O
caliber O
, O
and O
modeling O
methodology O
( O
delamater O
et O

, O

) O

in O
our O
study O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
estimated O
r0 O
is O
largely O
dependent O
on O
whether O
all O
the O
infected O
cases O
have O
been O
identified O

according O
to O
the O
report O
from O
ministry O
of O
health O
, O
labour O
and O
welfare O
, O
all O
the O
suspected_cases O
and O
cases O
who O
had O
close_contact O
with O
confirmed_cases B-COVID
had O
received O
viral O
nucleic_acid O
testing O

therefore O
, O
the O
proportion O
of O
unidentified O
cases O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
low O

in O
contrast O
, O
prior O
published_studies O
were O
mainly O
focused O
on O
the O
estimation O
of O
r0 O
in O
wuhan O
, O
china O
wu O
et O
al. O
, O
2020 O
) O

these O
estimates O
of O
r0 O
may O
be O
biased O
because O
a O
large O
population O
of O
infected O
cases O
were O
not O
identified O
during O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
disease O
outbreak O

another O
attractive O
feature O
of O
investigating O
the O
r0 O
on O
the O
ship O
is O
that O
the O
total O
number O
of O
population O
on O
board O
is O
relatively O
fixed O
, O
which O
perfectly O
matches O
the O
premise O
of O
epidemic O
models O
when O
studying O
the O
transmissibility O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
( O
yan O
, O

) O

moreover O
, O
compared O
with O
prior O
studies O
wu O
et O
al. O
, O

) O
, O
the O
driving_force O
of O
zoonotic O
infection B-COVID
was O
absent O
among O
the O
population O
on O
the O
ship O

therefore O
, O
the O
r0 O
in O
our O
study O
only O
reflected O
the O
human-to-human O
transmissibility O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
, O
rather O
than O
a O
composite O
of O
zoonotic O
and O
human-level O
transmissibility O

our O
findings O
suggested O
that O
the O
r0 O
was O
still O
high O
although O
quarantine O
measures O
have O
been O
taken O
on O
the O
ship O
, O
indicating O
that O
other O
transmission_routes O
may O
be O
neglected O
, O
such O
as O
aerosol O
transmission O
via O
the O
central O
air_conditioning O
system O
or O
drainage O
systems O

the O
latter O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
sars-cov O
outbreak O
in O
a O
building O
in O
hong_kong O
in O
2003 O
( O
anon O
, O
2020 O
) O

otherwise O
, O
unidentified O
asymptomatic O
cases O
or O
cases O
within O
incubation B-COVID
may O
also O
cause O
continuous O
spread O
of O
the O
novel O
virus O
, O
which O
may O
also O
partially_explain O
why O
r0 O
was O
still O
high O
at O
this O
stage O

we O
also O
made O
a O
prediction O
of O
daily O
incidence O
and O
the O
probable O
size O
of O
the O
outbreak O
for O
the O
next O
ten O
days O

according O
to O
our O
analysis O
, O
the O
daily O
incidence O
and O
the O
size O
of O
outbreak O
are O
largely O
dependent O
on O
the O
value O
of O
r0 O

if O
the O
r0 O
value O
remained_unchanged O
, O
the O
cumulative O
number O
of O
infected O
cases O
may O
reach O
1514 O
at O
the O
tenth O
day O
, O
suggesting O
more O
than O
forty O
percent O
of O
the O
population O
would O
be O
infected O

fortunately O
, O
the O
crew O
has O
taken O
more O
stringent O
measures O
to O
control O
the O
spread O
of O
infection B-COVID

as O
a O
result O
, O
the O
transmissibility O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
reduced O
in O
the O
coming O
days O

if O
the O
r0 O
value O
is O
reduced O
by O
50 O
% O
, O
the O
infected O
cases O
will O
be O
reduced O
by O
about O
half O

if O
the O
r0 O
value O
can O
further O
be O
reduced O
to O
less O
than O
1 O
, O
the O
number O
of O
infectious_disease O
cases O
will O
gradually O
taper O
off O
and O
finally O
perish O

our O
data-driven O
analysis O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O
controlling O
the O
transmissibility O
among O
population O
at O
this O
stage O

the O
current O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O

first O
, O
because O
of O
the O
limited O
population O
number O
on O
board O
and O
the O
high O
infectiousness O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
, O
with O
the O
rapid O
increase O
in O
number O
of O
infected O
cases O
, O
the O
proportion O
of O
susceptible_population O
will O
be O
decreased O
rapidly O

therefore O
, O
our O
findings O
are O
constrained O
to O
a O
limited O
time O
frame O
and O
the O
result O
may O
be O
changed O
after O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
cases O
were O
infected O

second O
, O
some O
confirmed_cases B-COVID
were O
intentionally O
removed O
from O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
, O
and O
this O
measure O
would O
affect O
the O
natural O
process O
of O
disease O
transmission O

if O
a O
considerable O
number O
of O
confirmed_cases B-COVID
were O
removed O
, O
the O
computed O
r0 O
would O
be O
underestimated O

third O
, O
the O
prediction O
was O
based O
on O
the O
existing O

from O
the O
ministry O
of O

, O

; O
a O
delay O

what O

that O

this O

the O

these O

, O
13 O
the O
effectiveness O

the O

5 O
in O
addition O
, O
successful O
contact_tracing O
and O
reducing O
the O
delay O
between O
symptom O

isolation O
are O
crucial O
, O
because O
, O
during O

additional O

it O
is O

that O

, O

( O

96 O

is O
not O

, O

it O
is O
clear O
that O

path O
of O
the O

could O
be O
crucial O
for O

further O
exposure O

outbreaks O
in O
the O

the O
sars-cov-2 O

which O

, O
compared O

however O
, O
an O

as O

another O
important O
key O
point O
is O
the O
role O
of O
humoral_immunity O
that O
, O
as O
for O

might O
not O
be O

to O
keep O

after O

, O

vary O
from O
5 O

6 O

, O
with O
a O

up O

however O
, O
the O
knowledge O

improve O
the O
estimates O
of O
the O
rates O

among O

; O
thus O
, O
increasing O
the O

additionally O
, O
it O
could O
significantly O
change O
the O
forecasting O
projection O
models O
on O
the O
worldwide O
outbreak O
evolution O

in O
this O
sense O
, O
recently_published O
studies O
have O
estimated O
a O

of O
3.28 O
, O
exceeding O
the O
initial O
world_health_organization O
( O
who O
) O
estimates O
of O
1.4 O
to O
2.5 O

the O
basic_reproductive_number O
is O
an O
indication O

the O

number O
of O
new O

generated O
by O
a O

thus O
, O
when O
it O

, O
the O

be O

moreover O

during O
the O

the O

is O
that O
the O

included O

not O

the O
main O
purpose O
of O
this O
work O
is O
to O
propose O
a O
conceptual_model O
to O
address O
the O
individual O
reaction O
( O
controlled O
by O
k O
) O
and O
governmental_action O
( O
controlled O
by O

) O
, O
as O
well O
as O
time-varying O

we O
perform O
a O
simple O
sensitivity O
ity O
analyses O
on O
α O
and O
k O
in O
figure O

, O
where O
we O
can O
see O
that O
both O
α O
and O
k O
are O
needed O
to O
capture O
the O
observed O
pattern O

in O
particular O
, O
when O
α O
is O
around O
0.9 O
and O
k O
is O
greater O
than O
110 O
, O
the O
simulated O
largely O
match O
the O
observed O

we O
used O
some O
parameter_estimates O
from O
( O
he O
et O
al. O
, O
2013 O
) O

the O
estimates O
were O
obtained O
via O
fitting O
a O
mechanistic O
model O
to O
the O
observed O
weekly O
influenza O
and O
pneumonia B-COVID
mortality O
in O
england O
and O
wales O
during O
the O
1918 O
influenza_pandemic O

recent_studies O
showed O
that O
covid-19 B-COVID
transmitted O
rapidly O

in O
this O
regard O
, O
it O
resembles O
influenza O
rather O
than O
sars O

in O
our O
1918 O
influenza O
work O
( O
he O
et O
al. O
, O
2013 O
) O
, O
we O
built O
a O
similar O
model O
as O
we O
introduced O
here O
, O
and O
we O
fitted O
that O
model O
to O
weekly O
influenza O
and O
pneumonia B-COVID
mortality O
in O
334 O
administrative_units O

note O
that O
1918 O
influenza O
had O
an O
infection-fatality-rate O
of O
2 O
% O
, O
which O
was O
at O
the O
same O
level O
of O
the O
case-fatality-rate O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
in O
wuhan O
, O
china O

the O
merit O
of O
our O
model O
is O
that O
we O
considered O
some O
essential O
elements O
, O
including O
individual O
behavioural O
response O
, O
governmental O
actions O
, O
zoonotic O
transmission O
and O
emigration O
of O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
in O
a O
short O
time O
period O

meanwhile O
, O
our O
model O
is O
relatively O
simple O
and O
our O
estimates O
are O
in O
line O
with O
previous_studies O
( O
imai O
et O
al. O
, O
2020 O
; O
j. O
t. O
wu O
et O
al. O
, O

; O

thus O
, O
our O
model O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
baseline O
model O
for O
further O
improvement O

we O
avoid O
to O
fit O
model O
to O
data O
in O
conventional O
way O

instead O
, O
we O
use O
a O
simple O
model O
framework O
to O
discuss O
what O
elements O
might O
be O
needed O

for O
instance O
, O
in O
order O
to O
achieve O
a O
good O
fitting O
performance O
, O
one O
obviously O
needs O
to O
include O
a O
time-varying O
report O
rate O
( O
as O
we O
reconstructed O
in O
figure_4b O
) O
, O
which O
was O
caused O
by O
the O
availability O
of O
medical O
supplies O
, O
hospital O
capacities O
and O
changing O
testing/reporting O
policies O

thus O
it O
would O
be O
challenging O
given O
a O
relatively O
short O
time O
series O
, O
and O
several O
other O
unknown O
parameters O
to O
be O

we O
employ O
some O

from O

given O
the O

in O
the O

firstly O
, O
ophthalmologists O
are O
extremely O

of O
particular O
concern O
is O
the O
proximity O

during O
the O

it O

, O
a O
range O
that O
definitely O
encompasses O
the O
distance O
between O
the O
patient O
and O

secondly O
, O
during O
the O
sars-cov O
epidemic O
, O
clinical O
reports O
have O
suggested O
tears O
as O
a O
medium O
of O

be O
detected O
by O

from O
the O

since O
there O
are O
too O
many O
parameters O
in O
our O
model O
, O
several O
limitations O
exist O
in O
this O
study O

firstly O
, O
we O
did O
not O
use O
the O
detailed O
data O
of O
the O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
to O
perform O
the O
estimation O
instead O
of O
using O
the O
data O
from O
literatures O

we O
simulated O
the O
natural_history O
of O
the O

that O
the O
proportion O
of O
asymptomatic O
infection B-COVID
was O
50 O
% O
, O
and O
the O
transmissibility O
of O
asymptomatic O
infection B-COVID
was O
half O
of O
that O
of O
symptomatic O
infection B-COVID
, O
which O
were O
different O
to O
those O
of O
mers B-COVID
and O
sars O

it O
is O
known O
that O
the O
proportion O
of O
asymptomatic O
infection B-COVID
of O
mers B-COVID
and O
sars O
was O
lower O
than O
10 O
% O

secondly O
, O
the O
parameters O
of O
population O
mobility O
were O
not O
from O
an O
accurate O
dataset O

thirdly O
, O
since O
there O
was O
no O
data O
of O
the O
initial O
prevalence O
of O
the O
virus O
in O
the O
seafood O
market O
, O
we O
assumed O
the O
initial O
value O
of O
1/100 O
000 O

this O
assumption O
might O
lead O
to O
the O
simulation O
been O
under-or O
over-estimated O

in O
addition O
, O
since O
we O
did O
not O
consider O
the O
changing O
rate O
of O
the O
individual O
's O
activity O
( O
such O
as O
wearing_masks O
, O
increasing O
social_distance O
, O
and O
not O
to O
travel O
to O
wuhan O
city O
) O
, O
the O
estimation O
of O
importation O
of O
the O
virus O
might O
not O
be O
correct O

all O
these O
limitations O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
our O
results O

therefore O
, O
the O
accuracy O
and O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
estimation O
would O
be O
better O
if O
the O
models O
fit O
the O
first-hand O

on O
the O
population O

and O
the O
data O
on O
the O
natural_history O
, O
the O
epidemiological O
characteristics O
, O
and O
the O
transmission O
mechanism O
of O
the O
virus O

by O
calculating O
the O
published O
data O
, O
our O
model O
showed O
that O
the O
transmissibility O
of O

might O
be O
higher O
than O
mers B-COVID
in O
the O

, O
similar O
to O

but O
lower O

this O

was O

finally O

the O

my O

developing O
neutralizing_antibodies O
to O
2019-ncov O
coronavirus B-COVID
entry O
starts O
with O
the O
s O
protein O
binding O
to O
a O
target O
receptor O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
, O
where O
after O
fusion O
is O
mediated O
at O
the O
cell_membrane O
, O
delivering O
the O
viral O
nucleocapsid O
inside O
the O
cell O
for O
subsequent O
replication O
14 O

the O
s O
protein O
is O
famous O
for O
causing O
syncytial O
formation O
between O
infected_cells O
and O
other O
receptor-bearing O
cells O
around O
them O
, O
emphasizing O
that O
the O
s O
protein O
does O
not O
function O
in O
just O
the O
virion O
state O
alone O

a O
neutralizing_antibody O
targeting O
the O
s O
protein O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
is O
likely O
the O
first O
therapy O
contemplated O
by O
biomedical O
researchers O
in O
academia O
and O
industry O
, O
providing O
passive_immunity O
to O

the O
recently_published O
genome_sequence O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
( O
genbank O
: O
mn908947.3 O
) O
allows O
researchers O
to O
perform O
gene O
synthesis O
in O
the O
lab O
and O
consider O
expressing O
the O
s O
protein O
as O
an O
immunogen O

traditional O
methods O
of O
screening O
mice O
or O
rabbits O
for O
neutralizing_antibodies O
may O
be O
too O
slow O
for O
this O
outbreak O
, O
but O
faster O
methods O
such O
as O
using O
phage O
or O
yeast O
display O
libraries O
that O
express O
antibody O
fragments O
could O
be O
used O
quickly O
to O
identify O
lead O
candidates O
for O
viral O
neutralization O
16 O
, O
17 O

the O
challenge O
is O
that O
any O
antibody O
candidate O
would O
need O
to O
be O
rigorously O
tested O
in O
cell_culture O
and O
animal O
models O
to O
confirm O
that O
it O
can O
neutralize O
2019-ncov B-COVID
and O
prevent O
infection B-COVID

furthermore O
, O
several O
isolates O
would O
need O
to O
be O
tested O
that O
are O
circulating O
in O
the O
population O
to O
try O
to O
assess O
if O
sufficient O
breadth O
of O
coverage O
is O
obtained O
with O
the O
neutralizing_antibody O

information O
from O
other O
coronaviruses O
species O
like O
sars O
would O
be O
helpful O
as O
to O
where O
to O
target O
the O
best O
epitope O
in O
order O
to O
produce O
neutralizing_antibodies O
( O
the O
receptorbinding_domain O
in O
the O
s O
protein O
is O
a O
key O
target O
) O
18 O
, O
but O
again O
this O
is O
a O
slow O
and O
challenging O
process O
, O
which O
may O
not O
yield O
significant O
gains O
for O
several O
months O

moreover O
, O
ultimately O
a O
cocktail O
of O
antibodies O
may O
be O
required O
to O
ensure O
full O
protection O
for O
patients O
, O
which O
would O
add O
additional O
complexity O
for O
formulation O
and O
manufacturing O

like O
some O
of O
the O
therapeutic_options O
discussed O
below O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
express O
any O
lead O
candidates O
in O
lower O
organisms O
for O
protein O
expression O
( O
bacteria O
, O
yeast O
, O
insect O
cells O
) O
would O
facilitate O
faster O
production O
of O
therapy O
for O
patients O
19 O

an O
alternative O
strategy O
of O
generating O
neutralizing_antibodies O
against O
2019-ncov B-COVID
s O
protein O
would O
be O
to O
immunize O
large O
animals O
( O
sheep B-LIVESTOCK
, O
goat B-LIVESTOCK
, O
cow B-LIVESTOCK
) O
with O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
s O
protein O
, O
and O
then O
purifying O
polyclonal_antibodies B-LIVESTOCK
from O
the O
animals O
20 O

this O
strategy O
may O
serve O
an O
expedited O
service O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
an O
outbreak O
and O
has O
many O
advantages O
such O
as O
simplifying O
production O
and O
manufacturing O
, O
but O
has O
limited O
guarantees O
that O
each O
animal O
would O
produce O
neutralizing O
antisera O
, O
or O
what O
the O
antibody O
titer O
would O
be O
in O
each O
animal O
21 O

moreover O
, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
human O
immune_response O
against O
foreign O
immunoglobulins O
to O
other O
species O
, O
which O
would O
potentially O
complicate O
any O
treatment O
scenarios O
22 O

in O
a O
truly O
desperate O
scenario O
, O
this O
strategy O
may O
be O
viable O
for O
a O
short-term O
, O
but O
would O
not O
easily O
scale O
in O
the O
2019-ncov O
outbreak O
, O
which O
is O
already O
rapidly O
multiplying O

using O
oligonucleotides O
against O
2019-ncov O
rna O
genome O
beyond O
targeting O
the O
surface O
proteins O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
, O
one O
could O
also O
target O
the O
rna O
genome O
itself O
for O
degradation O

this O
rna O
genome_sequence O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
was O
recently_published O
( O
gen-bank O
: O
mn908947.3 O
) O
, O
and O
one O
strategy O
that O
could O
be O
considered O
then O
, O
is O
the O
use O
of O
small_interfering_rna O
( O
sirna O
) O
or O
antisense_oligonucleotides O
( O
aso O
) O
to O
combat O
the O
virus O
by O
targeting O
its O
rna O
genome O
23 O

the O
challenge O
with O
this O
strategy O
is O
multifold O

first O
, O
the O
conserved O
rna O
sequence O
domains O
of O
cov-2019 O
are O
not O
known O

identifying O
conserved O
sequences O
is O
essential O
in O
order O
to O
optimize O
sirna O
targeting O
and O
avoid O
viral O
escape O
of O
the O
oligonucleotide O
strategy O

one O
could O
look O
at O
genome O
homology O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
to O
the O
sars O
virus O
for O
comparison O
of O
conserved O
sequences O
, O
but O
this O
would O
still O
be O
guesswork O

a O
second O
challenge O
is O
how O
the O
oligonucleotides O
would O
be O
delivered O
into O
the O
lungs O

advances O
have O
been O
made O
into O
delivery_vehicles O
such O
as O
lipid O
nanoparticles O
that O
can O
mediate O
some O
delivery O
into O
the O
lungs O
24 O

it O
is O
unknown O
, O
however O
, O
if O
enough O
sirna O
's O
or O
aso O
's O
would O
be O
effectively O
delivered O
within O
the O
lungs O
to O
stop O
the O
infection B-COVID
or O
make O
a O
difference O
in O
its O
clinical O
course O

for O
example O
, O
if O
25 O
% O
of O
alveolar O
epithelial_cells O
in O
the O
lung O
had O
sirna O
or O
aso O
in O
them O
, O
that O
efficiency O
might O
be O
a O
great O
success O
for O
traditional O
gene_therapy O
, O
but O
would O
hardly O
make O
any O
difference O
in O
a O
viral_infection O

such O
an O
explanation O
is O
also O
likely O
why O
sirna O
candidates O
against O
ebola O
failed O
in O
trials O
25 O
, O
despite O
significant O
success O
in O
preclinical O

models O
26,27 O

lastly O
, O
even O
if O
one O
assumed O
that O
sirna O
was O
effective O
clinically O
, O
there O
is O
a O
limited O

a O
simple O

very O

that O

to O

some O

these O

likely O
neutralize O

prevent O

and O
the O
patients O

should O
produce O
2019-ncov B-COVID

patients O

simply O

and O
then O
this O

can O
be O
transfused O

37 O

given O
that O

donation O
is O
well O
established O
, O
and O
the O

is O
also O
routine O

, O
this O

does O
not O
need O
any O
new O
science O
or O
medical O
approvals O
in O
order O
to O
be O
put O
into O
place O

indeed O
, O
the O
same O
rationale O
was O
used O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
several O
ebola O
patients O
with O
convalescent_serum O
during O
the O
outbreak O
in O
2014 O
- O
2015 O
, O
including O
two O
american O
healthcare O
workers O
who O
became O
infected O
38 O

as O
the O
outbreak O
continues O
, O
more O
patients O
who O
survived O
infection B-COVID
will O
become O
available O
to O
serve O
as O
donors O
to O
make O
antisera O
for O
2019-ncov B-COVID
, O
and O
a O
sizeable O
stock O
of O
antisera O
could O
be O
developed O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
the O
sickest O
patients O

unfortunately O
, O
the O
exponential_growth O
of O
the O
outbreak O
would O
work O
against O
this O
strategy O
, O
since O
the O
growing O
number O
of O
cases O
would O
likely O
outstrip O
the O
ability O
of O
previous O
patients O
to O
provide O

moreover O
, O
convalescent_patient O

would O
have O
significant O
variability O
in O
the O
potency O
of O
antiviral O

, O
making O
it O
less O
ideal O
37 O

while O

should O
certainly O
pursue O
convalescent_patient O
sera O
as O
an O
option O
right O
now O
for O
patient O
treatment O
, O
it O
is O
ultimately O
limited O
in O
its O
effective O
scope O
of O
controlling O
the O
outbreak O

the O
simplest O
and O
most O
direct O
approach O
to O
combating O
2019-ncov B-COVID
during O
the O
outbreak O
would O
be O
one O
to O
neutralize O
the O
virus O
from O
entering O
cells O
, O
the O
function O
that O
antibodies O
normally O
perform O
in O
the O
body O
39 O

for O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
when O
discussing O
neutralizing_antibodies O
, O
it O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
validate O
a O
broadly_neutralizing O
antibody O
quickly O
, O
and O
a O
challenge O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
mutating O
rna_virus O
will O
not O
escape O
its O
neutralization O

a O
cocktail O
antibody O
approach O
could O
be O
undertaken O
as O
was O
explored O
to O
treat O
the O
ebola O
pandemic O
40 O
, O
but O
would O
add O
complexity O
to O
the O
manufacturing O
process O

however O
, O
there O
is O
another O
strategy O
to O
pursue O
in O
this O
scenario O
that O
does O
not O
rely O
on O
targeting O
the O
viral O
glycoprotein B-VIRAL_PROTEIN
directly O

in O
this O
strategy O
, O
a O
neutralizing O
effect O
could O
be O
obtained O
by O
targeting O
the O
viral O
receptor O
protein O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
, O
thereby O
blocking O
the O
virus O
from O
binding O
to O
it O
and O
gaining O
entry O

fortunately O
, O
scientists O
have O
already O
uncovered O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
viral O
receptor O
in O
cell_culture O

a O
recent O
pre-print O
publication O
found O
that O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
uses O
the O
angiotensin-converting_enzyme O
2 O
( O
ace2 O
) O
as O
a O
receptor O
for O
cell O
entry O
41 O
, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
receptor O
that O
the O
sars O
coronavirus B-COVID
uses O
for O
entry O
42 O

for O
both O
viruses O
, O
the O
coronavirus B-COVID
binds O
to O
ace2 O
through O
its O
s O
protein O
on O
the O
virion O
, O
where O
after O
fusion O
of O
the O
viral O
membrane O
and O
cell_membrane O
will O
occur O

subsequently O
, O
the O
rna_virus O
will O
replicate O
its O
genome O
inside O
the O
cell O
, O
and O
ultimately O
make O
new O
virions O
that O
will O
be O
secreted O
to O
infect O
other O
cells O

the O
coincidence O
of O
sars O
and O
2019-ncov B-COVID
using O
ace2 O
receptor O
opens O
up O
the O
possibility O
of O
using O
the O
extensive O
research O
studied O
on O
sars O
entry O
and O
applying O
it O
to O
2019-ncov B-COVID

based O
on O
the O
sars O
literature O
, O
several O
potential O
blocking O
strategies O
could O
be O
considered O
, O
which O
were O
shown O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
preventing O
infection B-COVID
in O
sars O
models O

blocking O
agents O
that O
bind O
to O
ace2 O
receptor O
the O
first O
strategy O
would O
consist O
of O
administering O
to O
patients O
an O
agent O
that O
would O
bind O
to O
ace2 O

the O
key O
advantage O
here O
is O
that O
the O
host O
ace2 O
protein O
will O
not O
change O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
concern O
about O
escape O
from O
binding O
the O
therapeutic_agent O

moreover O
, O
the O
virus O
will O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
mutate O
and O
bind O
an O
entirely O
new O
host O
receptor O
in O
the O
time O
frame O
of O
this O

; O
such O
functional O
relationships O
are O
established O
by O
evolution O
over O
long O
periods O

by O
analogy O
, O
the O
influenza_virus O
changes O
the O
mutations O
on O
its O

every O
year O
, O
but O
it O
always O
focuses O
on O
using O
sialic_acid O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
as O
an O
entry O
receptor O
43 O

there O
are O
two O
known O
options O
for O
agents O
to O
bind O
to O
ace2 O

the O
first O
is O
using O
the O
small O
receptor-binding O
domain O
( O
rbd O
) O
from O
the O
sars O
s O
protein O
that O
has O

the O
key O
domain O

, O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
effectively O
block O
the O
entry O
of O
sars O

44 O

it O
is O
well O
within O
reason O
that O
sars O
rbd O
could O
be O
given O
to O
patients O
, O
thereby O
binding O
their O
ace2 O
proteins O
on O
target O
cells O
, O
preventing O
infection B-COVID
( O

there O
is O
also O
the O
potential O
for O
the O
equivalent O
rbd O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
to O
be O
produced O
and O
used O
as O
a O
therapy O
as O

this O
strategy O
assumes O
sars O
and O
2019-ncov B-COVID
share O
the O
same O
binding_site O
on O

is O
highly O

in O
regards O
to O
the O
outbreak_situation O
that O
is O
ongoing O
, O
the O
small O
protein O
facilitates O
the O
rapid O
production O
of O
the O

in O

potentially O
, O
which O
would O
help O

moreover O
, O
bacterial O

would O
allow O

of O

today O

alternatively O

a O
second O

to O

any O
of O

the O

are O
several O
limitations O
to O

two O
options O

regarding O
the O

strategy O
, O
the O
body O
would O
likely O
develop O
an O
immune_response O

eventually O
, O
although O
the O
key O

fall O
under O
this O
window O

alternatively O
, O
if O

were O
to O
use O
the O
homologous O
rbd O

itself O
, O
this O
immune_response O
would O
likely O
be O
very O
advantageous O
since O
it O
could O
yield O
both O
a O
blocking O
effect O
and O
a O

52 O

for O
both O
strategies O
, O
the O
dose O
that O
would O
be O
needed O
to O
block O

in O
the O

as O
is O
the O

that O

, O
could O
ultimately O
prove O
prohibitive O
for O
this O
strategy O

moreover O
, O
the O
turnover O
of O
the O
ace2 O

on O
the O

would O
also O
influence O
how O

, O
via O

lastly O
, O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
that O

this O
suggests O
that O

rather O
than O

63 O

one O
difference O
from O
the O

is O
that O
the O

this O
may O
facilitate O
faster O
activation O

, O
which O
was O

compared O
to O

that O
neutralized O

64 O

overall O
, O
the O
ace2-fc O
fusion_protein O
would O
have O
many O
of O
the O

benefits O
of O
a O
traditional O

that O
would O
be O
sought O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
the O
infection B-COVID
, O
but O
represent O
one O
with O
maximal O
breadth O
and O
potency O
since O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
could O
not O
escape O
its O
neutralization O
, O
given O
the O
same O
protein O
is O
also O
its O
receptor O
for O
cell O
entry O

indeed O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
sars O
versus O
the O
more O
mild O
human O
coronavirus B-COVID
nl63 O
was O
related O
to O
a O
lower O
affinity O
of O
nl63 O
for O

, O
with O
nl63 O
s O
protein O
reducing O

less O
than O

65 O

therefore O
, O
if O
2019-ncov B-COVID
were O
to O
try O
to O
escape O
ace2 O
neutralization O
via O
decreasing O
affinity O
, O
it O
would O
mutate O
into O
a O
less O
pathogenic O
virus O

this O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
re-emergent O
sars O
virus O
in O
2003 O
- O
2004 O
, O
which O
had O
lower O
affinity O
for O
human O
ace2 O
and O
resulted O
in O
less O
severe O
infection B-COVID
and O
no O
secondary O
transmission O
66 O

thus O
, O
2019-ncov B-COVID
could O
be O
presented O
with O
an O
evolutionary O
trap O
when O
faced O
with O
potential O
ace2-fc O

leading O

if O
anything O

more O

that O

one O
potential O
limitation O
of O
the O
ace2-fc O
strategy O
is O
that O
the O
increase O
in O

have O
unknown O

levels O

so O
the O
circulation O

would O
not O
be O
unprecedented O
72 O

moreover O
, O

amino_acid O

this O

, O
as O

accordingly O
, O
the O
official O
numbers O

both O
cases O

reported O
from O

represent O
the O
` O
` O
tip O

'' O
, O
potentially O
skewing O
case_fatality O
estimates O
towards O
patients O

as O
the O

thus O
, O

may O
be O
more O
accurate O

that O

appear O

overall O
renders O
this O
hypothesis O
plausible O

as O
the O

there O
may O

a O
delay O
of O
fatal_cases O

their O
reporting O

the O

number O

indicate O
that O

hence O
, O
the O
numbers O
, O
e.g O

in O
guangdong O
with O

, O
might O
be O

testing O

have O
been O

so O
that O

this O
is O
unlikely O
at O
this O
point O
as O

caused O
by O

in O

hence O
, O
the O

less O

14 O
days O

at O
the O
time O

, O
we O
have O
detailed O
information O
on O
its O
relationship O
to O
other O

, O
many O
of O
which O
were O

on O

clinical O
findings O
, O
the O
epidemiology O
of O

, O
and O
on O
its O

to O
other O
countries O

these O
rapid O
and O
successful O
results O
are O
a O
resounding O
endorsement O
of O
china O
's O
emergence O
as O
a O
21st_century O
scientific O
superpower O
, O
and O
of O
a O
country O
with O

a O

of O

cdcs O
that O
are O
trained O
in O

and O

however O
, O
despite O
these O
efforts O
, O
this O
novel O
virus O
was O
able O
to O
spread O
via O
infected O
people O
traveling O
within O
china O
and O
internationally O

furthermore O
, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
spillover O
that O
led O
to O
human O
infection B-COVID
is O
still O
uncertain O
, O
although O
it O
has O
all O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
a O
bat-origin O
sars-related O
coronavirus B-COVID
( O
sarsr-cov O
) O

this O
leads O
us O
to O
two O
questions O
that O
we O
need O
to O
think O
⁎ O
corresponding O
author O

through O
even O
now O
to O
get O
ready O
to O
prevent O
the O
next O
2019-ncov-like O
pandemic O
: O
the O
first O
question O
is O
why O
did O
this O
virus O
spread O
so O
rapidly O
, O
and O
how O
can O
we O
deal O
with O
this O
risk O

china O
has O
changed O
significantly O
since O
the O
emergence O
of O
sars O
in O
2002 O
- O
2003 O

the O
economy O
has O
expanded O
, O
and O
many O
people O
have O
become O
wealthier O
, O
leading O
to O
an O
expansion O
of O
air O
and O
high-speed_train O
travel O

it O
is O
estimated O
that O
3 O
billion O
individual O
journeys O
were O
planned O
during O
the O
lunar O
new O
year O
holiday O
( O
chunyun O
) O
, O
around O
80 O
million O
of O
these O
being O
flights O

the O
flight O
habits O
of O
chinese O
citizens O
have O
changed O
alsowith O
many O
more O
flying O
internationally O
for O
business O
or O
tourism O

in O
addition O
, O
since O
2003 O
, O
there O
has O
been O
an O
increase O
in O
travel O
between O
china O
and O
african_countries O
, O
across O
southeast_asia O
and O
into O
the O
new O
world O
as O
part O
of O
china O
's O
expansion O
of O
business O
and O
trade O

this O
largely O
explains O
why O
the O
virus O
was O
able O
to O
spread O
out O
of O
china O
much O
more O
rapidly O
than O
sars-cov B-COVID
, O
which O
took O
over O
2 O
months O
to O
move O
to O
hong_kong O
then O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O

the O
second O
question O
is O
what O
is O
the O
source O
of O
this O
virus O

the O
evidence O
is O
fairly O
clear O
: O
most O
of O
the O
initial O
cases O
were O
linked O
to O
a O
seafood O
market O
that O
also O
sold O
butchered O
livestock B-LIVESTOCK
meat O
and O
some O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE

the O
virus O
itself O
appears O
to O
have O
a O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
( O
bat B-WILDLIFE
) O
origin O
similar O
to O
sars-cov B-COVID
, O
which O
also O
emerged O
in O
a O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
market O
through O
the O
interactions O
of O
humans O
and O
other O
animals O
that O
acted O
as O
the O
intermediate_hosts O
of O
the O
virus O

with O
two O
disease O
outbreaks O
originating O
in O
china O
significantly O
linked O
to O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
markets O
, O
this O
is O
an O
obvious O
target O
for O
control O
programs O
to O
prevent O
future O
epedemics O
and O
pandemics O

indeed O
, O
there O
have O
already O
been O
calls O
from O
chinese O
conservationists O
, O
public_health O
leaders O
and O
policy_makers O
to O
reduce O
the O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
consumption O

however O
, O
banning O
or O
even O
reducing O
the O
sale O
of O
wild O
game O
may O
not O
be O
straightforward O
and O
it O
is O
challenging O
to O
change O
behaviors O
that O
are O
influenced O
by O
chinese_culture O
and O
traditions O

in O
addition O
to O
a O
strong O
belief O
in O
the O
purported O
curative O
power O
of O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
and O
their O
by-products O
, O
the O
consumption O
of O
the O
rare O
and O
expensive O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
has O
become O
a O
social O
statement O
of O
wealth O
boosted O
by O
economic_growth O

changing O
these O
cultural O
habits O
will O
take O
time O
, O
however O
, O
recent O
behavioral O
questionnaire O
data O
suggests O
a O
generational O
transformation O
with O
reduced O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
consumption O
in O
the O
younger O
generation O

there O
is O
no O
doubt O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
wildlife_trade O
has O
an O
inherent O
risk O
of O
bringing O
people O
close O
to O
pathogens O
that O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
carry O
, O
that O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
encountered O
, O
and O
that O
have O
the O
potential O
of O
leading O
to O
the O
next O
outbreak O

here O
, O
we O
propose O
three O
key_steps O
to O
helping O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
a O

have O
triggered O
a O
strong O

long-term O

dealing O

a O
global O

china O

located O
within O
a O
major O

in O

also O
a O
high O

of O
future O

originating O
in O
sub-saharan_africa O
, O
south_asia O
and O

furthermore O
, O
the O
drivers O
of O

are O
human O
activities O
that O
are O
expanding O
on O
a O
global O
scale O
, O
including O
deforestation O
, O

and O
the O

this O

led O

an O

in O
the O
frequency O
of O
animal-human O

and O
likelihood O
of O

, O
suggesting O
that O

will O
become O
more O
frequent O
and O
more O
devastating O
in O
the O
future O

these O
threats O
face O
all O
countries O

once O

, O
they O
travel O
rapidly O

freely O
through O

we O

actually O
implies O
that O
it O

, O
especially O
to O

without O
much O
knowledge O
of O

the O

also O
not O

with O
the O

sars-cov-2 B-COVID
, O
as O
a O
naturally_occurring O

naming O

is O
therefore O
truly O
misleading O

for O
such O
an O

international O
concern O

it O

its O

2019-ncov B-COVID

still O
evolving O
, O
and O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
predict O
the O

of O
the O

some O
experts O
predicted O
that O

evolve O
to O
a O
low_pathogenic O

which O

perhaps O
even O
around O

world O

people O
develop O
panic O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
a O

of O

with O
an O

even O

people O
may O
also O
believe O
that O

, O
2019-ncov B-COVID
will O
not O
re-emerge O
once O

therefore O
, O

are O
expected O
on O
the O

front O
as O

located O
in O
powerful O
countries O
that O

both O
economically O

such O
are O
deemed O
prized O
tokens O
on O
the O
international O
landscape O
, O
and O
it O
is O
expected O
that O
these O

will O
continue O
to O
work O
towards O
their O
predominant O
control O
as O
much O
as O
possible O

on O
the O

, O
the O

approach O
is O
being O
upheld O
where O
critical O
information O

are O
not O
freely O
shared O
between O

as O
that O

be O
seen O
to O

would O
cherish O
the O

in O

to O
the O
obvious O
deep-rooted O
social O

challenges O
include O
the O
increasing O
movement O
of O
people O
globally O
that O
is O
being O
enhanced O
by O
reduced O

and O
higher O

in O
particular O
, O
these O
challenges O
are O
more O
pronounced O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
public_health O

this O
is O
because O
most O
of O
the O
health-related O
data O
collected O
not O
only O
can O
compromise O
local O
nations O
, O
but O
also O
captures O
those O
of O

in O
such O
cases O
, O
in O
a O
bid O
to O
improve O
the O
health O
status O
of O
a O
nation O
, O
it O
becomes O
paramount O
to O
factor O
in O
data O
from O

necessitating O
unhindered O
sharing O
of O
this O

such O
data-sharing O
truth O
is O
emphasized O
in O
situations O
like O
the O
recent O
case O
of O
coronavirus B-COVID

threatening O
the O
global_health O

, O
facilitated O
by O

the O

( O

over O

the O

the O

in O
the O
above O

known O
to O
prepare O
themselves O
for O
potential O

, O
their O
health O
policies O
and O

are O
observed O
to O
diverge O
from O

another O

thus O
, O
without O
a O
global O

approach O
, O
progress O
towards O
working O
for O
a O
cure O
and O
universally O
acceptable O
policy O
approach O
can O
take O

such O
fears O
, O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
international_collaboration O
, O
were O
highlighted O
by O
the O
world_health_organization O
( O
who O
) O
during O
an O
emergency O
meeting O
in O
geneva O
on O
22nd O
january O
2020 O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O

had O
reached O
a_level O
warranting O
international O
emergency O
concern O

however O
, O
who O
was O
satisfied O
that O
china O
was O
being O
proactive O
in O
this O
case O
, O
unlike O
in O
2002 O
, O
when O
china O
withheld O
information O
on O
the O
outbreak O
for O
far O
too O
long O
, O
causing O
delays O
in O
addressing O
the O
epidemic O

as O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
it O
is O
the O
opinion O
in O
this O
paper O
that O
if O
there O
was O
seamless O
collaboration O
and O
seamless O

of O

between O

, O
it O
would O
not O
warrant O
such O
a O
high-level O
meeting O
to O
result O
in O
action O
, O
and O
instead O
, O
a O
decision O
could O
have O
been O
made O
much O
earlier O

on O
this O
, O
the O
saddest O
part O
is O
that O
some O
global O
cities O
are O
less O
prepared O
to O
handle O
the O
challenges O
posed O
by O
this O
type O
of O
outbreak O
for O
lack O
of O

on O

issues O

the O
timely O

in O

this O

are O
commendable O

the O

includes O
the O
severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome O
( O

in O

that O

substantial O
time O
( O
from O

) O
to O

the O

the O

that O

similarly O
, O
though O
substantial O

, O
wetsman O

that O
there O

the O

and O
this O
is O
a O
key O

as O
interactions O

this O

however O
, O
while O
that O

the O
foundations O
for O
this O
escalating O
loss O
can O
be O
witnessed O
in O
the O
rapid O
growth O
of O
travel O
bans O
being O
enacted O
by O
some O
countries O
and O
their O
international_airports O
, O
especially O

in O
china O
and O
their O
growth O
into O
general O
non-chinese O

on O
this O
, O
noting O
that O
the O
outbreak O
came O
almost O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
lunar O
new O

celebrations O
, O
and O
that O
it O
had O
been O
estimated O
that O
over O
400 O

were O
expected O
to O
travel O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
and O
china O
to O
observe O
this O
festivity O
, O
the O
majority O
have O
had O
to O
reconsider O
their O
options O
as O
to O

that O

transcend O
urban O

and O
impacts O
upon O
all O
other O
facets O
of O

therefore O
, O
it O
becomes O
paramount O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
measures O
taken O
to O
contain O
a O

transcend O
nationalist O
agendas O
where O

to O
a O
more O
global O
agenda O
where O
humanity O

encouraged O

with O
such O
an O
approach O
, O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
to O

this O
is O
possible O
by O
ensuring O

thus O
, O
human O

this O

more O

using O
additional O

( O

it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
not O

the O

but O
also O
the O
numerator O
values O
are O
subject O
to O
better O
estimation O
( O
e.g O

, O
our O
study O

the O

questions O
such O
as O
shown O
below O
are O
key O
questions O
for O
the O
field O
to O
be O
moving O
forward O
: O
1 O

what O
are O
the O
mechanisms O
whereby O
exercise O
affects O
various O

on O
your O
observation O

experience O
, O
which O
areas O
should O
the O
chinese O
scholars O
and O
laboratories O
further O
improve O
and O
focus O
on O

woods O
: O
yes O
, O
i O
get O
many O
inquiries O
from O
chinese O
and O
other O
international O
students O
about O
potentially O
working O
in O
my O
laboratory O
as O
a O
pre-doctoral O
student O

the O
main O
advice O
that O
i O
would O
give O
these O
students O
is O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
you O
have O
( O
a O
) O
a O
strong O
academic O
record O
that O
includes O
basic O
science O
courses O
( O
i.e. O
, O

) O
, O
( O
b O
) O
evidence O
of O

, O
and O
( O

) O
tangible O
research O
output O
( O
i.e. O
, O
abstracts O
, O
publications O
, O
and O
presentations O
) O
in O
your O
field O

i O
would O
also O
caution O
about O
using O
cold O
call O
e-mails O
that O
do O
not O
reflect O
careful O
thought O
and O
research O
relative O
to O
the O
individual O
you O
are O
contacting O

you O
should O
read O
the O
work O
and O
understand O
the O
research O
interests O
of O
the O
professor O
you O
are O
contacting O
while O
also O
making O
a O
case O
that O
you O
have O
strong O
interests O
and O
skills O
in O
this O
area O

most O
of O
the O
chinese O

i O
have O
mentored O
came O
to O
me O
on O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
i O
know O
and O
trust O
( O

it O

the O

while O

it O

the O

critical O

explicitly O
does O
not O

the O
importance O

this O
is O
clearly O

the O
fact O
that O

the O

it O
clearly O
shows O
that O

the O
need O
for O
the O

the O
proportionality O

only O
be O

there O
was O
little O

was O
suggested O
to O
be O
the O
result O

, O
it O

the O

a O

the O

an O

a O

to O
the O

( O

the O
next O
important O
factor O
to O
consider O
for O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
outbreak O
is O
our O
ability O
to O
contain O
the O

consequently O
, O
the O

to O
approximately O
8100 O
people O
in O
29 O
countries O
and O
resulted O
in O
774 O

10 O
since O
mild O
illness O
is O
uncommon O
in O
