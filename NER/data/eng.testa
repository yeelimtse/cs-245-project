further O
analysis O
even O
suggested O
that O

recognizes O

more O
efficiently O
than O
sars-cov B-COVID
increasing O
the O
ability O

thus O
, O
the O

also O
have O
a O

this O
similarity O

is O
critical O
because O

, O
this O

was O

by O

thus O

for O

we O
therefore O
previously O

that O

a O
key O
question O
is O
why O
the O

appears O
to O
be O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
target O
organ O

one O
reason O
is O
that O
the O

the O

there O

also O
a O
biological O
factor O

for O

may O

several O
limitations O
of O
the O
present O
study O
exist O

first O
, O
the O
dataset O
relies O
on O
publicly O
available O
information O
that O
is O
not O
uniformly_distributed O
( O
i.e. O
, O
collected O
from O
various O
sources O
) O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
availability O
of O
dates O
relevant O
to O
our O
analyses O
is O
limited O
to O
a O
small O
, O
selective O
sample O
that O
is O
not O
necessarily O
generalizable O
to O
all O
confirmed_cases B-COVID

moreover O
, O
given O
the O
novelty O
of O
the O
covid-19 B-COVID
pneumonia B-COVID
, O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
illness_onset O
and O
other O
event O
data O
were O
handled O
differently O
between O
jurisdictions O
( O
e.g. O
, O
was O
illness_onset O
the O
date O
of O
fever B-COVID
or O
date O
of O
dyspnea B-COVID
? O
) O

second O
, O
our O
data O
include O
very O
coarse O
date O
intervals O
with O
some O
proxy O
dates O
used O
to O
determine O
the O
left O
and/or O
right O
hand O
dates O
of O
some O
intervals O

third O
, O
as O
the O
sample_size O
was O
limited O
, O
the O
variance O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
biased O

fourth O
, O
we O
were O
not O
able O
to O
examine O
the O
heterogeneity O
of O
estimates O
by O
different O
attributes O
of O
cases O
( O
e.g. O
, O
severity O
of O
disease O
) O

lastly O
, O
as O
we O
only O
have O
information O
on O
confirmed_cases B-COVID
, O
there O
is O
a O
bias O
towards O
more O
severe_disease-particularly O
for O
earlier O
cases O

this O
study O
presents O
the O
estimates O
of O
epidemiological O

that O

we O
found O
that O
the O
length O

should O
be O
at O

14 O

, O
and O
we O
stress O
that O
the O
17 O
- O
24-day O
time O
delay O
from O

must O
be O
addressed O
when O

a O

factors O
that O
resulted O

in O
2002 O

2003 O
, O
the O
outbreak O
of O
sars O
brought O
a O
disaster O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the O
world O
, O
especially O
the O
chinese O
people O

fortunately O
, O
sars O
was O
finally O
defeated O
, O
and O
chinese O
health O
departments O
upgraded O
their O
disease O
prevention O
and O
control O
system O
by O
summing O
up O
their O
experiences O
of O
fighting O
sars O

thus O
, O
when O
covid-19 B-COVID
appeared O
, O
the O
whole O

quickly O
entered O
a O
state O
of O
fighting O
against O
the O

policies O
led O
by O
the O
national_health_commission O
have O
been O

efficiently O
, O
and O
chinese O
scientists O
identified O
the O
etiology O
of O
the O
disease O
in O
no O
more O
than O
a O
month O

however O
, O
new O
cases O
are O
increasing O
every O

, O
showing O
a O
trend O
of O
spreading O
to O
the O
whole O
country O
and O
across O
the O
world O

covid-19 B-COVID
appeared O
just O
one O
month O
before O
the O
spring_festival O
of O
china O
, O
and O
the O
massive O
population O
flow O
has O
brought O
great O
challenges O
for O
disease O
prevention O
and O
control O

this O
virus O
can O
be O
transmitted O
from O
human O
to O
human O
and O
no O
effective O
treatment O
drug O
has O
been O
found O

the O
most O
effective O
prevention O
and O
control_measures O
are O
to O
find O
suspected O
patients O
and O
close_contacts O
, O
confirm O
patients O
and O
virus O
carriers O
, O
and O
block O
the O
transmission O
through O
isolation O
, O
disinfection O
, O
and O
personal_protection O

therefore O
, O
early O
detection O
, O
isolation O
, O
and O
treatment O
of O
patients O
are O
the O
key O
measures O
to O
control O
the O
source O
of O
infection B-COVID
and O
reduce O
the O
infection B-COVID
rate O

it O
is O
also O
crucial O
to O
avoid O
nosocomial_infection O
by O
strengthening O
the O
management O
of O
medical O
staff O
and O
patients O

health O
education O
on O
knowledge O
for O
disease O
prevention O
and O

is O
also O
important O

finally O
, O
if O
we O
want O
to O
eliminate O
the O
threat O
of O
this O
novel O

pneumonia B-COVID
similar O

, O
we O

) O
always O
prepare O

another O
confusion O
is O
, O
when O

, O
everyone O
asks O

how O

do O
to O

is O
there O
any O

these O
questions O
takes O
time O

there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
wait O

all O
these O
questions O
are O
resolved O
before O

we O
can O
take O
actions O
to O
prevent O
covid-19 B-COVID
immediately O
while O
waiting O
for O
answers O
to O
these O
questions O

this O
is O
because O
we O
have O
the O
evidence-based O
strategy O
for O
control O
and O
prevention O
of O
any O
infectious_disease O
without O
complete O
understanding O

an O

that O
is O
so-called O
tri-component O

the O

of O
infection B-COVID
, O
identifying O
and O
blocking O
the O

paths O
, O
and O
protecting O
those O
who O
are O
susceptible O

this O
was O
just O
what O

has O
done O
, O

doing O
, O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
do O
this O

typical O

we O

which O

also O
apply O

a O
good O
example O
is O
the O

whereas O
the O

the O

in O
the O

has O
a O

and O
has O
so O

resulted O
in O
only O
a O

another O
example O
is O
that O

it O

very O
different O

in O
the O
case O
of O

, O
there O
have O
been O
some O
clues O

that O
, O
sometimes O
, O
an O
individual O
with O
highly O
severe O
2019-ncov B-COVID

will O
only O
cause O
a O

, O
conversely O
, O
individuals O

can O
occasionally O
cause O
many O

, O
though O
the O
molecular O
mechanism O

not O

a O
possible O
consequence O
of O
this O
is O
that O
viral O

that O

on O

information O

whether O
the O

the O

based O
on O
above O

, O
the O
current O
2019-ncov B-COVID
seems O
to O
have O
relatively O
low O

however O
, O
more O

then O
converted O

The O

boiled O
over O

walk O
off O

what O
he O
claimed O

a O
game-winning O

" O

" O

generally O
honest O

him O
a O

he O

out O

that O

Edberg S-PER

who O
upset O

Richard B-PER

in O
the O

" O
This O

one O

I O
did O

I O
had O
to O
fight O
hard O
. O
" O

Edberg S-PER

tenacity O
paid O
off O
in O
the O
second O
set O

Edberg S-PER
lost O
his O
own O

twice O
, O
but O
he O
rallied O
for O
three O
breaks O
of O
his O
own O
, O
the O

to O

up O
the O

" O
That O
's O
where O
the O
match O
sort O
of O
changed O
, O
" O
said O
Edberg S-PER

" O

I O
think O
once O
I O
got O
that O
second O
set O
, O
I O
felt O
a O

better O
about O
my O

" O

Edberg S-PER

pretty O
good O
about O

" O
It O

look O

that O
bad O
, O
" O
Edberg S-PER

of O

path O

starting O
next O
with O
a O

against O

Paul B-PER

However O
, O

" O
I O

" O
said O
Edberg S-PER

" O

Like O
I O
said O
many O

I O

it O

a O
very O

chance O

nothing O

impossible O
