A O

[3, O

found O
a O

origin O
for O
the O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID

There O
is O
a O
diversity O
of O
possible O
intermediate O
hosts O
for O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
including O
pangolins B-WILDLIFE
but O
not O
mice O
and O

[5] O

There O
are O
many O
similarities O
of O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
with O
the O
original O
SARS B-COVID
CoV B-COVID

Using O
computer O
modeling, O
Xu O
et O

[6] O
found O
that O
the O
spike_proteins B-VIRAL_PROTEIN
of O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
and O
SARS B-COVID
CoV B-COVID
have O
almost O
identical O
3-D O

the O

that O

SARS-CoV_spike_protein B-VIRAL_PROTEIN

SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID

share O
76 O

in O

[6] O
and, O
importantly, O
the O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
and O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID

proteins O
have O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
homology O
[6, O

Wan O

 O
[4] O
reported O
that O
residue O
394 O
(glutamine) O
in O
the O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
receptor-binding O
domain O
(RBD), O
corresponding O
to O
residue O
479 O
in O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
can O
be O
recognized O
by O
the O
critical O
lysine O
31 O
on O
the O
human O
ACE2 O
receptor O
[8] O

Further O
analysis O
even O
suggested O
that O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
recognizes O
human O
ACE2 O
more O
efficiently O
than O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
increasing O
the O
ability O
of O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
to O
transmit O
from O
person O
to O
person O
[4] O

Thus, O
the O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
spike_protein B-VIRAL_PROTEIN
was O
predicted O
to O
also O
have O
a O
strong O
binding O
affinity O
to O
human O
ACE2 O


This O
similarity O
with O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
is O
critical O
because O
ACE2 O
is O
a O
functional O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
receptor O
in O
vitro O
[9] O
and O
in O
vivo O
[10] O

It O
is O
required O
for O
host O
cell O
entry O
and O
subsequent O
viral O
replication O

Overexpression O
of O
human O
ACE2 O
enhanced O
disease O
severity O
in O
a O
mouse O
model O
of O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
infection, O
demonstrating O
that O
viral O
entry O
into O
cells O
is O
a O
critical O
step O
[11] O
; O
injecting O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
spike O
into O
mice O
worsened O
lung O
injury O


Critically, O
this O
injury O
was O
attenuated O
by O
blocking O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
pathway O
and O
depended O
on O
ACE2 O
expression O
[12] O

Thus, O
for O
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
pathogenesis, O
ACE2 O
is O
not O
only O
the O
entry O
receptor O
of O
the O
virus O
but O
also O
protects O
from O
lung O
injury O

We O
therefore O
previously O
suggested O
that O
in O
contrast O
to O
most O
other O
coronaviruses B-COVID
sars B-COVID
cov B-COVID
became O
highly O
lethal O
because O
the O
virus O
deregulates O
a O
lung O
protective O
pathway O
[10, O
12] O
Zhou O
et O
al O
[13] O
demonstrated O
that O
overexpressing O
ACE2 O
from O
different O
species O
in O
HeLa O
cells O
with O
human O
ACE2, O
pig B-LIVESTOCK
ACE2, O
civet O
ACE2 O
(but O
not O
mouse O
ACE2) O
allowed O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
infection O
and O
replication, O
thereby O
directly O
showing O
that O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
uses O
ACE2 O
as O
a O
cellular O
entry O
receptor O


They O
further O
demonstrated O
that O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
does O
not O
use O
other O
coronavirus B-COVID
receptors O
such O
as O
aminopeptidase O
N O
and O
dipeptidyl O
peptidase O
4 O
[13] O


In O
summary, O
the O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
spike_protein B-VIRAL_PROTEIN
directly O
binds O
with O
the O
host O
cell O
surface O
ACE2 O
receptor O
facilitating O
virus O
entry O
and O
replication O


A O
key O
question O
is O
why O
the O
lung O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
most O
vulnerable O
target O
organ O


One O
reason O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
surface O
area O
of O
the O
lung O
makes O
the O
lung O
highly O
susceptible O
to O
inhaled O
viruses, O
but O
there O
is O
also O
a O
biological O
factor O

Using O
normal O
lung O
tissue O
from O
eight O
adult O
donors, O
Zhao O
et O
al O
[14] O
demonstrated O
that O
83% O
of O
ACE2-expressing O
cells O
were O
alveolar O
epithelial O
type O
II O
cells O
(AECII), O
suggesting O
that O
these O
cells O
can O
serve O
as O
a O
reservoir O
for O
viral O
invasion O

In O
addition, O
gene O
ontology O
enrichment O
analysis O
showed O
that O
the O
ACE2-expressing O
AECII O
have O
high O
levels O
of O
multiple O
viral O
process-related O
genes, O
including O
regulatory O
genes O
for O
viral O
processes, O
viral O
life O
cycle, O
viral O
assembly, O
and O
viral O
genome O
replication O
[14] O
, O
suggesting O
that O
the O
ACE2-expressing O
AECII O
facilitate O
coronaviral O
replication O
in O
the O
lung O

Expression O
of O
the O
ACE2 O
receptor O
is O
also O
found O
in O
many O
extrapulmonary O
tissues O
including O
heart, O
kidney, O
endothelium, O
and O
intestine O
[15] O
[16] O
[17] O
[18] O
[19] O

Importantly, O
ACE2 O
is O
highly O
expressed O
on O
the O
luminal O
surface O
of O
intestinal O
epithelial O
cells, O
functioning O
as O
a O
co-receptor O
for O
nutrient O
uptake, O
in O
particular O
for O
amino O
acid O
resorption O
from O
food O
[20] O


We O
therefore O
predict O
that O
the O
intestine O
might O
also O
be O
a O
major O
entry O
site O
for O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
and O
that O
the O
infection O
might O
have O
been O
initiated O
by O
eating O
food O
from O
the O
Wuhan O
market, O
the O
putative O
site O
of O
the O
outbreak O

Whether O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
can O
indeed O
infect O
the O
human O
gut O
epithelium O
has O
important O
implications O
for O
fecal-oral O
transmission O
and O
containment O
of O
viral O
spread O


ACE2 O
tissue O
distribution O
in O
other O
organs O
could O
explain O
the O
multi-organ O
dysfunction O
observed O
in O
patients O
[21] O
[22] O
[23] O


Of O
note, O
however, O
according O
to O
the O
Centers O
for O
Disease O
Control O
and O
Prevention O
[24], O
whether O
a O
person O
can O
get O

by O

or O
objects O
that O
have O

[25] O
recently O
demonstrated O
that O
initial O
spike O
protein O
priming O
by O
transmembrane O
protease O
serine O
2 O
(TMPRSS2) O
is O
essential O
for O
entry O
and O
viral O
spread O
of O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
through O
interaction O
with O
the O
ACE2 O
receptor O
[26, O
27] O

The O
serine O
protease O
inhibitor O
camostat O
mesylate, O
approved O
in O
Japan O
to O
treat O
unrelated O
diseases, O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
block O
TMPRSS2 O
activity O
[28, O
29] O
and O
is O
thus O
an O
interesting O
candidate O

The O
interaction O
sites O
between O
ACE2 O
and O
SARS B-COVID
cov B-COVID
have O
been O
identified O
at O
the O
atomic O
level O
and O
from O
studies O
to O
date O
should O
also O
hold O
true O
for O
interactions O
between O
ACE2 O
and O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID


Thus, O
one O
could O
target O
this O
interaction O
site O
with O
antibodies O
or O
small O
molecules O
Kuba O
et O
al O
[10] O
demonstrated O
in O
mice O
that O
SARS B-COVID
CoV B-COVID
downregulates O
ACE2 O
protein O
(but O
not O
ACE) O
by O
binding O
its O
spike_protein B-VIRAL_PROTEIN
contributing O
to O
severe O
lung O
injury O

This O
suggests O
that O
excessive O
ACE2 O
may O
competitively O
bind O
with O
SARS-CoV-2 B-COVID
not O
only O
to O
neutralize O
the O
virus O
but O
also O
rescue O
cellular O
ACE2 O
activity O
which O
negatively O
regulates O
the O
renin-angiotensin O
system O
(RAS) O
to O
protect O
the O
lung O
from O
injury O
[12, O
30] O

Indeed, O
enhanced O
ACE O
activity O
and O
decreased O
ACE2 O
availability O
contribute O
to O
lung O
injury O
during O
acid-and O
ventilator-induced O
lung O
injury O
[12, O
31, O
32] O

Thus, O
treatment O
with O
a O
soluble O
form O
of O
ACE2 O
itself O
may O
exert O
dual O
functions: O
(1) O
slow O
viral O
entry O
into O
cells O
and O
hence O
viral O
spread O
[7, O
9] O
and O
(2) O
protect O
the O
lung O
from O
injury O
[10, O

Notably, O
a O
recombinant O
human O
ACE2 O
(rhACE2; O

been O
found O
to O

in O
