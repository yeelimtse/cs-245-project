the O

the O

the O
model O
of O

, O
similar O

is O
that O

at O

it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
find O
a O
mechanism O
for O
the O
very O
quick O
outbreak O
in O
such O
a O
wide O
area O
by O
a O
natural O
source O
of O
sars-cov-2 O

epidemiological O
investigations O
showed O
that O
13 O
of O
the O
first O
41 O
patients O
diagnosed O
with O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
huanan_seafood_market O

another O
survey O
of O
sars-2 B-COVID
found O
that O
no O
bats B-WILDLIFE
were O
on O
sale O
in O
huanan_seafood_market O

with O
so O
many O
bats B-WILDLIFE
concentrated O
into O
a O
local O
area O
, O
the O
spreading O
of O
viruses O
by O
bats B-WILDLIFE
might O
be O
much O
wider O
than O
just O
being O
restricted O
to O
one O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
trading O
place O
such O
as O
the O
huanan_seafood_market O

the O
viruses O
might O
have O
lived O
in O
this O
big O
` O
` O
incubation B-COVID
bed O
'' O
for O
some O
time O
and O
achieved O
some O
mutations O
before O
jumping O

the O
final O
hosts-human O

a O
study O
on O
horseshoe_bats O
in O
hong_kong O
and O
guangdong O
showed O
that O
the O
viruses O
carried O
by O
horseshoe_bats O
in O
these O
two O
places O
are O
different O

however O
, O
some O
horseshoe_bats O
were O
found O
to O
carry O
two O
viruses O
after O
mating O
and O
foraging O
activity O

this O
indicates O
that O
horseshoe_bats O
not O
only O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
migrate O
, O
but O
also O
the O
ability O
to O
promote O
the O
spread O
of O
virus O
within O
the O
same O
roost O
and O
from O
roost O
to O
roost O

in O
addition O
, O
sequencing O
the O
entire O
genome O
of O
virus O
carried O
by O
bats B-WILDLIFE
in O
multiple O
regions O
revealed O
frequent O
recombination O
among O
different O
strains O

for O
example O
, O
civet O
sarsr-cov O
sz3 O
recombination O
was O
detected O
between O
sarsr-rh-batcov O
rp3 O
from O
guangxi O
, O
china O
, O
and O
rf1 O
from O
hubei O
, O
china O

therefore O
, O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
that O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
spread O
from O
zhoushan O
to O
wuhan O
due O
to O
bat B-WILDLIFE
migration O

it O
turned O
out O
that O
bats B-WILDLIFE
are O
not O
only O
attracted O
by O
green O
lights O
but O
also O
red O
lights O

along O
the O
yangtze_river O
there O
are O
also O
huge O
bridges O
decorated O
with O
a O
massive O
number O
of O
red O
lights O

thus O
, O
bats B-WILDLIFE
migrating O
along O
the O
yangtze_river O
might O
be O
attracted O
by O
these O
red O
lights O
and O
be O
relocated O
nearby O

wuhan O
might O
be O
a O
new O

for O
a O
massive O
number O
of O
bats B-WILDLIFE

these O

, O
coming O

, O
might O

separate O
evolution O
and O
the O

might O
lead O
to O

not O

it O

cases O
ranged O
from O
12.5 O
% O

25 O
% O
in O
some O
mers-cov B-COVID

a O
similar O
phenomenon O
may O
be O

with O

would O
make O

even O

another O
parameter O
to O
consider O
is O
the O
possibility O
of O
super_spreading O
in O
the O
context O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID

super_spreading O
is O
the O
amplified O
transmission O
of O
a O
virus O
by O
individuals O
in O
a O
population O
and O
has O
been O
suggested O
by O
at O

the O
rate O

however O
, O
roughly O

have O
been O
associated O
with O

these O
cases O
seeded O
a O
significant O
portion O
of O
the O

around O
the O
world O

notably O
, O
neither O
mutations O
in O
the O
viruses O
nor O

were O
found O
to O
be O

however O
, O
the O
recent O
increase O
in O
cases O
, O
both O

could O
signal O
the O
existence O
of O

alternatively O

our O
study O
has O
several O
limitations O

we O
considered O
flights O
from O
four O
cities O
of O
china O
, O
three O
of O
which O
( O
beijing O
, O
shanghai O

) O
are O
ranked O
among O
top O
five O

( O
based O
on O
the O
number O
of O

) O
in O
china O
and O
wuhan O
as O
the O
site O
of O
origin O
of O

while O
including O
further O
cities O
in O
our O
analysis O
would O
have O
added O
further O
information O
, O
beijing O
and O
shanghai O
cover O
most O
of O
the O
international O
destinations O
to O
which O
other O
airports O
are O
connected O

further O
, O
we O
have O
adjusted O
for O
the O
number O
of O
reported O
cases O
in O
each O
departure O

when O
developing O
the O
model O
, O
we O
initially O
explored O
using O
only O
wuhan O
as O
the O
departure O
airport O
, O
the O
rank O
of O
top O
10 O
at-risk O
countries O
remained O
the O
same O

thus O
our O
findings O
are O
still O
representative O
of O
the O
total O
risk O
posed O
by O
other O
airports O
or O
cities O

we O
did O
not O
consider O
the O
risk O
associated O
with O
the O
travel O
route O
through O
water O
and O
land O
which O
might O
have O
an O
impact O
in O
the O
spread O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID

another O
limitation O
is O
that O
the O
model O
does O
not O
account O
for O
travel_patterns O
in O
other O
affected_countries O

for O
example O
, O
some O
cases O
have O
started O
acquiring O

: O
the O

case O
notified O
in O
the O

the O

in O

however O
overall O
, O
the O
risk O
compared O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
acquisition O
in O
china O
is O
very O
low O
, O
therefore O
it O
probably O
would O
not O
change O
the O
order O
of O
countries O

the O
risk O
of O
transmission O
of O
sars-cov-2 B-COVID
from O
china O
on O
31 O
january O

was O
highest O

` O

are O

? O

if O

no O
, O
then O

it O
would O

a O
small O

at O

in O
the O

this O

to O

only O

the O
distribution O
of O
these O

( O

) O
is O
nearly O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
` O
` O
silent O
'' O

, O
which O
generally O
have O
little O
functional O

this O
modest O

is O
in O
sharp_contrast O
with O
the O
sars O
virus O
at O
the O
stage O
of O

infection B-COVID

in O
this O
scenario O
, O
2019-ncovs O
might O
have O
been O
fully O
evolved O
when O
they O
emerged O
from O
their O
secondary O

into O

these O

'' O

the O

taken O

if O

indeed O
the O

, O
then O
the O

might O
be O
this O

the O
low O

rate O
, O
the O
high O

rate O
and O
the O

all O
seem O
to O
suggest O
2019-ncovs O
to O
be O
in O
a O
mature O
stage O

we O
wish O
this O

will O
turn O
out O

the O

down O

precaution O

the O

would O
be O
a O

while O
a O

our O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O

firstly O
, O
the O
seir_model O
was O
set O
up O
based O
on O
a O
number O
of O
necessary O
assumptions O

for O
example O
, O
we O
assumed O
that O
no O
super-spreaders O
exist O
in O
the O
model O
, O
but O
there O
is O
currently O
no O
supportive O
evidence O

secondly O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
estimation O
model O
depends O
largely O
on O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
parameters O
it O
used O
, O
such O
as O
incubation_period O

with O
more O
precise O
parameters O
obtained O
as O
the O
epidemic O
progresses O
, O
our O
estimation O
model O
will O
also O
be O
more O
precise O

our O
estimates O
of O
the O
reproductive_number O
from O
3.1 O
to O
0.5 O
are O
based O
on O
previous_studies O
and O
experience O
from O
sars O
control O

however O
, O
this O
measure O
may O
change O
substantially O
over O
the O
course O
of O
this O
epidemic O
and O
as O
additional O
data O
arrives O

besides O
, O
using O
a O
fixed O
r O
t B-WILDLIFE
value O
in O
each O
phase O
may O
incur O
potential O
bias O
because O
r O
t B-WILDLIFE
is O
essentially O
a O
dynamic O
parameter O

thirdly O
, O
these O
estimated O
data O
may O
not O
be O
sustained O
if O
unforeseeable O
factors O
occurred O

for O
example O
, O
if O
some O
infections O
were O
caused O
by O
multiple O
exposures O
to O
animals O
, O
these O
estimates O
will O
be O
exposed O
to O
a O
big O
uncertainty O

fourthly O
, O
the O
epidemic O
trend O
shows O
great O
difference O
between O
wuhan O
and O
hubei_province B-COVID
and O
regions O
in O
mainland_china B-COVID
outside O
hubei_province B-COVID
according O
to O
the O
nhc O
reported O
data O

it O
is O
thus O
inappropriate O
to O
generalize O
the O
estimations O
in O
wuhan O
to O

in O
mainland_china B-COVID
outside O
hubei_province B-COVID

the O
dynamics O

for O
the O
other O
locations O
in O
mainland_china B-COVID
remains O
to O
be O
developed O
and O
specific O

to O
be O
redefined O

lastly O

we O

not O

this O
is O
not O

that O

although O
we O
have O
previously O
found O
mers-cov B-COVID
circulating O
in O

from O
this O
region O

it O
is O
possible O
that O
herders O
are O
at O
lower O
risk O
than O
slaughterhouse O
workers O
because O
camels O
brought O
to O
slaughterhouses O
often O
transit O
via O
camel O
markets O
where O
mixing O
of O
camels O
from O
diverse O
sources O
allows O
for O
amplification O
of O
virus O
circulation O
which O
may O
result O
in O
higher O
rates O
of O

and O
greater O
mers-cov B-COVID
exposure O
of O
these O
slaughterhouse O

in O

, O
the O
ppnt O

were O
1:40 O
and O

this O
is O
not O
unexpected O
as O
even O
patients O
with O

do O
not O
invariably O
mount O
robust O
neutralising O

elisa O

unless O
they O

thus O
, O
people O
with O
mild O

may O
have O
low O
or O
undetectable O
antibody O

to O
mers-cov B-COVID
, O
and O
furthermore O
, O
such O

may O
wane O

considerably O
under-estimate O

the O

the O

by O
different O
studies O
indicate O
that O
precisely O
estimating O

is O
quite O
challenging O
, O
because O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
calculate O
the O
exact O
number O
of O
infected O
cases O
during O
an O

otherwise O
, O
the O

, O
statistical O
caliber O
, O

( O

in O
our O
study O
, O
the O
accuracy O
of O
estimated O
r0 O
is O
largely O
dependent O
on O
whether O
all O
the O

have O
been O
identified O

according O
to O
the O
report O
from O
ministry O
of O

and O

, O
all O
the O
suspected_cases O
and O
cases O
who O
had O
close_contact O
with O

had O
received O
viral O

therefore O
, O
the O
proportion O

is O
supposed O
to O
be O
low O

in O
contrast O
, O
prior O
published_studies O

on O
the O
estimation O
of O

in O

, O

) O

these O
estimates O
of O
r0 O
may O
be O
biased O
because O
a O
large O
population O
of O
infected O
cases O
were O
not O
identified O
during O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
disease O
outbreak O

another O
attractive O
feature O
of O
investigating O
the O
r0 O
on O
the O
ship O
is O
that O
the O
total O
number O
of O
population O
on O
board O
is O
relatively O
fixed O
, O
which O
perfectly O
matches O
the O
premise O
of O
epidemic O
models O
when O
studying O
the O
transmissibility O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
( O
yan O
, O

moreover O
, O
compared O
with O

, O
the O
driving_force O
of O
zoonotic O
infection B-COVID
was O
absent O
among O
the O
population O
on O
the O
ship O

therefore O
, O
the O
r0 O
in O
our O
study O
only O
reflected O
the O
human-to-human O
transmissibility O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
, O
rather O
than O
a O
composite O
of O
zoonotic O
and O
human-level O
transmissibility O

our O
findings O
suggested O
that O
the O
r0 O
was O
still O
high O
although O
quarantine O
measures O
have O
been O
taken O
on O
the O
ship O
, O
indicating O
that O
other O
transmission_routes O
may O
be O
neglected O
, O
such O
as O
aerosol O
transmission O
via O
the O
central O
air_conditioning O
system O
or O
drainage O
systems O

the O
latter O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
of O
the O

outbreak O
in O
a O
building O
in O
hong_kong O
in O

( O

otherwise O
, O
unidentified O
asymptomatic O
cases O
or O
cases O
within O
incubation B-COVID
may O
also O
cause O
continuous O
spread O
of O
the O
novel O

, O
which O
may O
also O
partially_explain O
why O
r0 O
was O
still O
high O
at O

stage O

we O
also O
made O
a O
prediction O
of O

and O
the O
probable O

of O
the O

for O

according O
to O
our O
analysis O
, O
the O
daily O
incidence O
and O
the O
size O
of O

are O
largely O
dependent O
on O
the O
value O
of O
r0 O

if O
the O
r0 O

, O
the O
cumulative O
number O
of O

may O
reach O
1514 O
at O
the O
tenth O

, O
suggesting O
more O
than O
forty O
percent O

the O

be O

fortunately O
, O
the O

has O
taken O
more O
stringent O
measures O
to O
control O
the O
spread O
of O

as O
a O
result O
, O
the O
transmissibility O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
reduced O
in O
the O
coming O
days O

if O
the O
r0 O
value O
is O
reduced O
by O
50 O
% O
, O
the O

will O
be O
reduced O
by O
about O
half O

if O
the O

further O
be O
reduced O
to O
less O
than O

, O
the O
number O

will O
gradually O
taper O
off O

finally O

our O
data-driven O
analysis O
highlights O
the O
importance O
of O
controlling O
the O
transmissibility O
among O
population O
at O
this O
stage O

the O
current O
study O
has O
some O
limitations O

first O
, O
because O
of O
the O
limited O
population O
number O
on O

and O
the O
high O
infectiousness O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
, O
with O
the O
rapid O
increase O
in O
number O
of O

cases O
, O
the O
proportion O
of O

will O
be O
decreased O
rapidly O

therefore O
, O
our O
findings O
are O
constrained O
to O
a O
limited O
time O
frame O
and O
the O
result O
may O
be O
changed O
after O
a O

second O
, O
some O
confirmed_cases B-COVID
were O
intentionally O
removed O
from O
the O

, O
and O
this O
measure O
would O
affect O
the O
natural O

transmission O

if O
a O
considerable O

, O
the O

, O
only O

) O
appeared O
in O
our O

( O

, O
due O
to O
their O
comparatively O
low O

second O
, O
computational_tools O
were O
used O
to O
predict O

we O
analyzed O

the O
role O

in O
the O

these O

13 O
the O
effectiveness O

the O

in O
addition O
, O
successful O
contact_tracing O

reducing O
the O

are O
crucial O
, O
because O
, O

however O
, O
if O

then O
additional O

several O

( O

another O
important O

is O
the O

however O
, O
the O

thus O
, O

in O
this O
sense O
, O

( O

the O

, O
we O
built O
a O
similar O
model O
as O
we O
introduced O
here O
, O
and O
we O
fitted O
that O
model O
to O
weekly O

note O
that O
1918 O
influenza O
had O
an O
infection-fatality-rate O
of O
2 O
% O
, O
which O
was O
at O
the O
same O
level O
of O
the O
case-fatality-rate O
of O
covid-19 B-COVID
in O
wuhan O
, O
china O

the O
merit O
of O
our O
model O
is O
that O
we O
considered O
some O
essential O
elements O
, O
including O
individual O
behavioural O
response O
, O
governmental O
actions O
, O
zoonotic O
transmission O
and O
emigration O
of O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
the O
population O
in O
a O
short O
time O
period O

meanwhile O
, O
our O
model O
is O
relatively O
simple O
and O
our O
estimates O
are O
in O
line O
with O
previous_studies O

thus O
, O
our O
model O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
baseline O
model O
for O
further O
improvement O

we O
avoid O
to O
fit O

instead O
, O
we O
use O
a O
simple O
model O
framework O
to O
discuss O
what O
elements O
might O
be O
needed O

for O
instance O
, O
in O

to O
achieve O
a O
good O

, O
one O
obviously O
needs O

was O
caused O
by O
the O
availability O
of O

and O

thus O
it O
would O

in O
the O

firstly O
, O
ophthalmologists O
are O
extremely O

on O

of O
particular O
concern O
is O
the O
proximity O
between O
the O

during O
the O

it O
has O

, O
a O
range O
that O
definitely O
encompasses O
the O
distance O
between O
the O
patient O
and O

secondly O
, O
during O
the O
sars-cov O
epidemic O
, O
clinical O
reports O
have O
suggested O
tears O
as O
a O
medium O
of O

be O

from O

it O
may O

finally O

the O

developing O
neutralizing_antibodies O
to O
2019-ncov O
coronavirus B-COVID
entry O
starts O
with O
the O
s O
protein O
binding O
to O
a O
target O
receptor O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
, O
where O
after O
fusion O
is O
mediated O
at O
the O
cell_membrane O
, O
delivering O
the O
viral O
nucleocapsid O
inside O
the O
cell O
for O
subsequent O
replication O
14 O

the O
s O
protein O
is O
famous O
for O
causing O
syncytial O
formation O
between O
infected_cells O
and O
other O
receptor-bearing O
cells O
around O
them O
, O
emphasizing O
that O
the O
s O
protein O
does O
not O
function O
in O
just O
the O
virion O
state O
alone O

a O
neutralizing_antibody O
targeting O
the O
s O
protein O
on O
the O
surface O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
is O
likely O
the O
first O
therapy O
contemplated O
by O
biomedical O
researchers O
in O
academia O
and O
industry O
, O
providing O
passive_immunity O
to O

15 O

the O
recently_published O
genome_sequence O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
( O
genbank O
: O
mn908947.3 O
) O
allows O
researchers O
to O
perform O
gene O
synthesis O
in O
the O
lab O
and O
consider O
expressing O
the O
s O
protein O
as O
an O
immunogen O

traditional O
methods O
of O
screening O
mice O
or O
rabbits O
for O
neutralizing_antibodies O
may O
be O
too O
slow O
for O
this O
outbreak O
, O
but O
faster O
methods O
such O
as O
using O
phage O
or O
yeast O
display O
libraries O
that O
express O
antibody O
fragments O
could O
be O
used O
quickly O
to O
identify O
lead O
candidates O
for O
viral O
neutralization O
16 O
, O
17 O

the O
challenge O
is O
that O
any O
antibody O
candidate O
would O
need O
to O
be O
rigorously O
tested O
in O
cell_culture O
and O
animal O
models O
to O
confirm O
that O
it O
can O
neutralize O
2019-ncov B-COVID
and O
prevent O
infection B-COVID

furthermore O
, O
several O
isolates O
would O
need O
to O
be O
tested O
that O
are O
circulating O
in O
the O
population O
to O
try O
to O
assess O
if O
sufficient O
breadth O
of O
coverage O
is O
obtained O
with O
the O
neutralizing_antibody O

information O
from O
other O
coronaviruses O
species O
like O
sars O
would O
be O
helpful O
as O
to O
where O
to O
target O
the O
best O
epitope O
in O
order O
to O
produce O
neutralizing_antibodies O
( O
the O
receptorbinding_domain O
in O
the O
s O
protein O
is O
a O
key O
target O
) O
18 O
, O
but O
again O
this O
is O
a O
slow O
and O
challenging O
process O
, O
which O
may O
not O
yield O
significant O
gains O
for O
several O
months O

moreover O
, O
ultimately O
a O
cocktail O
of O
antibodies O
may O
be O
required O
to O
ensure O
full O
protection O
for O
patients O
, O
which O
would O
add O
additional O
complexity O
for O
formulation O
and O
manufacturing O

like O
some O
of O
the O
therapeutic_options O
discussed O
below O
, O
the O
ability O
to O
express O
any O
lead O
candidates O
in O
lower O
organisms O
for O
protein O
expression O
( O
bacteria O
, O
yeast O
, O
insect O
cells O
) O
would O
facilitate O
faster O
production O
of O
therapy O
for O
patients O
19 O

an O
alternative O
strategy O
of O
generating O
neutralizing_antibodies O
against O
2019-ncov B-COVID
s O
protein O
would O
be O
to O
immunize O
large O
animals O
( O
sheep B-LIVESTOCK
, O
goat B-LIVESTOCK
, O
cow B-LIVESTOCK
) O
with O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
s O
protein O
, O
and O
then O
purifying O
polyclonal_antibodies B-LIVESTOCK
from O
the O
animals O
20 O

this O
strategy O
may O
serve O
an O
expedited O
service O
in O
the O
setting O
of O
an O
outbreak O
and O
has O
many O
advantages O
such O
as O
simplifying O
production O
and O
manufacturing O
, O
but O
has O
limited O
guarantees O
that O
each O
animal O
would O
produce O
neutralizing O
antisera O
, O
or O
what O
the O
antibody O
titer O
would O
be O
in O
each O
animal O
21 O

moreover O
, O
there O
is O
also O
the O
human O
immune_response O
against O
foreign O
immunoglobulins O
to O
other O
species O
, O
which O
would O
potentially O
complicate O
any O
treatment O
scenarios O
22 O

in O
a O
truly O
desperate O
scenario O
, O
this O
strategy O
may O
be O
viable O
for O
a O
short-term O
, O
but O
would O
not O
easily O
scale O
in O
the O
2019-ncov O
outbreak O
, O
which O
is O
already O
rapidly O
multiplying O

using O
oligonucleotides O
against O
2019-ncov O
rna O
genome O
beyond O
targeting O
the O
surface O
proteins O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
, O
one O
could O
also O
target O
the O
rna O
genome O
itself O
for O
degradation O

this O
rna O
genome_sequence O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
was O
recently_published O
( O
gen-bank O
: O
mn908947.3 O
) O
, O
and O
one O
strategy O
that O
could O
be O
considered O
then O
, O
is O
the O
use O
of O
small_interfering_rna O
( O
sirna O
) O
or O
antisense_oligonucleotides O
( O
aso O
) O
to O
combat O
the O
virus O
by O
targeting O
its O
rna O
genome O
23 O

the O
challenge O
with O
this O
strategy O
is O
multifold O

first O
, O
the O
conserved O
rna O
sequence O
domains O
of O
cov-2019 O
are O
not O
known O

identifying O
conserved O
sequences O
is O
essential O
in O
order O
to O
optimize O
sirna O
targeting O
and O
avoid O
viral O
escape O
of O
the O
oligonucleotide O
strategy O

one O
could O
look O
at O
genome O
homology O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
to O
the O
sars O
virus O
for O
comparison O
of O
conserved O
sequences O
, O
but O
this O
would O
still O
be O
guesswork O

a O
second O
challenge O
is O
how O
the O
oligonucleotides O
would O
be O
delivered O
into O
the O
lungs O

advances O
have O
been O
made O
into O
delivery_vehicles O
such O
as O
lipid O
nanoparticles O
that O
can O
mediate O
some O
delivery O
into O
the O
lungs O
24 O

it O
is O
unknown O
, O
however O
, O
if O
enough O
sirna O
's O
or O
aso O
's O
would O
be O
effectively O
delivered O
within O
the O
lungs O
to O
stop O
the O
infection B-COVID
or O
make O
a O
difference O
in O
its O
clinical O
course O

for O
example O
, O
if O
25 O
% O
of O
alveolar O
epithelial_cells O
in O
the O
lung O
had O
sirna O
or O
aso O
in O
them O
, O
that O
efficiency O
might O
be O
a O
great O
success O
for O
traditional O
gene_therapy O
, O
but O
would O
hardly O
make O
any O
difference O
in O
a O
viral_infection O

such O
an O
explanation O
is O
also O
likely O
why O
sirna O
candidates O
against O
ebola O
failed O
in O
trials O
25 O
, O
despite O
significant O
success O
in O
preclinical O

models O
26,27 O

lastly O
, O
even O
if O
one O
assumed O
that O
sirna O
was O
effective O
clinically O
, O
there O
is O
a O

these O

likely O
neutralize O
the O

prevent O
new O
rounds O
of O

and O
the O
patients O

should O
produce O
2019-ncov B-COVID

patients O

cases O

simply O
donate O

, O
and O
then O
this O

can O
be O
transfused O
into O

37 O

given O
that O

is O
well O
established O
, O
and O
the O

is O
also O
routine O

does O
not O
need O
any O

in O

be O
put O
into O

indeed O
, O
the O
same O
rationale O
was O
used O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
several O
ebola O
patients O
with O
convalescent_serum O
during O
the O
outbreak O
in O
2014 O
- O
2015 O
, O
including O
two O
american O
healthcare O
workers O
who O
became O
infected O
38 O

as O
the O
outbreak O
continues O
, O
more O
patients O
who O
survived O
infection B-COVID
will O
become O
available O
to O
serve O
as O
donors O
to O
make O
antisera O
for O
2019-ncov B-COVID
, O
and O
a O
sizeable O
stock O
of O
antisera O
could O
be O
developed O
to O
serve O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
the O
sickest O
patients O

unfortunately O
, O
the O
exponential_growth O
of O
the O
outbreak O
would O
work O
against O
this O
strategy O
, O
since O
the O
growing O
number O
of O
cases O
would O
likely O
outstrip O
the O
ability O
of O
previous O
patients O
to O
provide O

moreover O
, O
convalescent_patient O

have O
significant O
variability O
in O
the O
potency O
of O

, O
making O
it O
less O
ideal O
37 O

while O

should O
certainly O
pursue O
convalescent_patient O
sera O
as O
an O
option O
right O
now O
for O
patient O
treatment O
, O
it O
is O
ultimately O
limited O
in O
its O
effective O
scope O
of O
controlling O
the O
outbreak O

the O
simplest O
and O
most O
direct O
approach O
to O
combating O
2019-ncov B-COVID
during O
the O
outbreak O
would O
be O
one O
to O
neutralize O
the O
virus O
from O
entering O
cells O
, O
the O
function O
that O
antibodies O
normally O
perform O
in O
the O
body O
39 O

for O
the O
reasons O
mentioned O
above O
when O
discussing O
neutralizing_antibodies O
, O
it O
will O
be O
difficult O
to O
validate O
a O
broadly_neutralizing O
antibody O
quickly O
, O
and O
a O
challenge O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
mutating O
rna_virus O
will O
not O
escape O
its O
neutralization O

a O
cocktail O
antibody O
approach O
could O
be O
undertaken O
as O
was O
explored O
to O
treat O
the O
ebola O
pandemic O
40 O
, O
but O
would O
add O
complexity O
to O
the O
manufacturing O
process O

however O
, O
there O
is O
another O
strategy O
to O
pursue O
in O
this O
scenario O
that O
does O
not O
rely O
on O
targeting O
the O
viral O
glycoprotein B-VIRAL_PROTEIN
directly O

in O
this O
strategy O
, O
a O
neutralizing O
effect O
could O
be O
obtained O
by O
targeting O
the O
viral O
receptor O
protein O
on O
the O
cell O
surface O
, O
thereby O
blocking O
the O
virus O
from O
binding O
to O
it O
and O
gaining O
entry O

fortunately O
, O
scientists O
have O
already O
uncovered O
the O
identity O
of O
the O
viral O
receptor O
in O
cell_culture O

a O
recent O
pre-print O
publication O
found O
that O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
uses O
the O
angiotensin-converting_enzyme O
2 O
( O
ace2 O
) O
as O
a O
receptor O
for O
cell O
entry O
41 O
, O
which O
is O
the O
same O
receptor O
that O
the O
sars O
coronavirus B-COVID
uses O
for O
entry O
42 O

for O
both O
viruses O
, O
the O
coronavirus B-COVID
binds O
to O
ace2 O
through O
its O
s O
protein O
on O
the O
virion O
, O
where O
after O
fusion O
of O
the O
viral O
membrane O
and O
cell_membrane O
will O
occur O

subsequently O
, O
the O
rna_virus O
will O
replicate O
its O
genome O
inside O
the O
cell O
, O
and O
ultimately O
make O
new O
virions O
that O
will O
be O
secreted O
to O
infect O
other O
cells O

the O
coincidence O
of O
sars O
and O
2019-ncov B-COVID
using O
ace2 O
receptor O
opens O
up O
the O
possibility O
of O
using O
the O
extensive O
research O
studied O
on O
sars O
entry O
and O
applying O
it O
to O
2019-ncov B-COVID

based O
on O
the O
sars O
literature O
, O
several O
potential O
blocking O
strategies O
could O
be O
considered O
, O
which O
were O
shown O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
preventing O
infection B-COVID
in O
sars O
models O

blocking O
agents O
that O
bind O
to O
ace2 O
receptor O
the O
first O
strategy O
would O
consist O
of O
administering O
to O
patients O
an O
agent O
that O
would O
bind O
to O
ace2 O

the O
key O
advantage O
here O
is O
that O
the O
host O
ace2 O
protein O
will O
not O
change O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
concern O
about O
escape O
from O
binding O
the O
therapeutic_agent O

moreover O
, O
the O
virus O
will O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
mutate O
and O
bind O
an O
entirely O
new O
host O
receptor O
in O
the O
time O
frame O
of O
this O

; O
such O
functional O
relationships O
are O
established O
by O

over O

by O
analogy O
, O
the O
influenza_virus O
changes O
the O

every O
year O
, O

it O
always O
focuses O
on O
using O
sialic_acid O
on O
the O

as O
an O
entry O
receptor O
43 O

there O
are O
two O
known O
options O
for O
agents O
to O
bind O
to O
ace2 O

the O
first O
is O
using O
the O
small O
receptor-binding O
domain O
( O
rbd O
) O
from O
the O
sars O
s O
protein O
that O

has O
been O

to O
effectively O
block O
the O

it O
is O
well O
within O
reason O
that O
sars O
rbd O
could O
be O
given O
to O
patients O
, O
thereby O
binding O
their O
ace2 O
proteins O
on O
target O
cells O
, O
preventing O
infection B-COVID
( O

there O
is O
also O
the O
potential O
for O
the O
equivalent O
rbd O
of O
2019-ncov B-COVID
to O
be O
produced O
and O
used O
as O
a O
therapy O
as O

this O
strategy O
assumes O
sars O
and O
2019-ncov B-COVID
share O
the O
same O
binding_site O
on O

is O
highly O

in O
regards O
to O
the O
outbreak_situation O
that O
is O
ongoing O
, O
the O
small O
protein O
facilitates O
the O
rapid O
production O
of O
the O

in O
bacteria O
potentially O
, O
which O
would O
help O

moreover O
, O
bacterial O

allow O

of O

today O
in O
china O

alternatively O

the O

a O
second O
, O

to O

the O

any O
of O
the O

the O
downside O
of O

the O

the O

the O

are O
several O
limitations O
to O
these O
two O
options O

regarding O
the O

strategy O
, O
the O
body O
would O
likely O
develop O
an O
immune_response O

eventually O
, O
although O
the O

fall O
under O

alternatively O
, O
if O

to O
use O
the O

itself O
, O
this O
immune_response O
would O
likely O
be O
very O
advantageous O
since O
it O
could O
yield O
both O
a O
blocking O
effect O
and O
a O

52 O

for O
both O
strategies O
, O
the O

, O
could O
ultimately O
prove O
prohibitive O
for O
this O
strategy O

moreover O
, O
the O
turnover O
of O
the O
ace2 O

also O
influence O
how O

lastly O
, O
there O
is O
the O
possibility O
that O

that O

how O
it O

, O
it O

that O
the O

the O

63 O

one O
difference O
from O
the O
prior O

strategies O
is O
that O
the O

of O
the O

be O
retained O
in O
this O

, O
allowing O

natural_killer_cells O
through O
the O

this O
may O
facilitate O
faster O
activation O
of O
the O
host O
antiviral O

and O
elimination O
of O
the O

, O
which O
was O
illustrated O
in O

model O
where O
fc O

were O
more O
potent O
in O
eliminating O

via O

of O

cells O
compared O
to O
antibodies O
that O
neutralized O

alone O
64 O

overall O
, O
the O
ace2-fc O
fusion_protein O
would O
have O
many O
of O
the O
same O
benefits O
of O
a O
traditional O
neutralizing_antibody O
that O
would O
be O
sought O
as O
a O
treatment O
for O
the O
infection B-COVID
, O
but O
represent O
one O
with O
maximal O
breadth O
and O
potency O
since O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
could O
not O
escape O
its O
neutralization O
, O
given O
the O
same O
protein O
is O
also O
its O
receptor O
for O
cell O
entry O

indeed O
, O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
the O
pathogenicity O
of O
sars O
versus O
the O
more O
mild O
human O
coronavirus B-COVID
nl63 O
was O
related O
to O
a O
lower O
affinity O
of O
nl63 O
for O
human O
ace2 O
versus O
sars O
, O
with O
nl63 O
s O
protein O
reducing O
ace2 O
levels O
less O
than O
sars O
s O

65 O

therefore O
, O
if O
2019-ncov B-COVID
were O
to O
try O
to O
escape O
ace2 O
neutralization O
via O
decreasing O
affinity O
, O
it O
would O
mutate O
into O
a O
less O
pathogenic O
virus O

this O
is O
similar O
to O
the O
re-emergent O
sars O
virus O
in O
2003 O
- O
2004 O
, O
which O
had O
lower O
affinity O
for O
human O
ace2 O
and O
resulted O
in O
less O
severe O
infection B-COVID
and O
no O
secondary O
transmission O
66 O

thus O
, O
2019-ncov B-COVID
could O
be O
presented O
with O
an O
evolutionary O
trap O
when O
faced O
with O
potential O
ace2-fc O

, O
leading O
toward O
a O

the O

of O

it O

be O
noted O
that O

if O
anything O
, O
2019-ncov B-COVID
is O
likely O
more O

given O
that O

only O

which O

one O
potential O
limitation O
of O
the O
ace2-fc O
strategy O
is O
that O
the O
increase O
in O
levels O
of O
extracellular O
ace2 O
could O
have O
unknown O
effects O
on O
the O
body O
, O
particularly O
when O

small O
levels O

already O

so O
the O
circulation O
of O
this O
extracellular O

would O
not O
be O
unprecedented O
72 O

moreover O
, O
recombinant O

well-tolerated O

, O
critical O
amino_acid O

, O
while O

this O
possibility O
was O
previously O
investigated O
in O

so O
it O
is O

another O
potential O

is O
that O

, O
as O

their O
limits O

accordingly O
, O
the O
official O
numbers O

both O

reported O
from O

represent O
the O
` O
` O
tip O

'' O
, O
potentially O
skewing O
case_fatality O
estimates O
towards O
patients O

as O
the O

thus O
, O

may O
be O
more O
accurate O

that O

appear O

overall O
renders O
this O
hypothesis O
plausible O

as O
the O

there O
may O

a O
delay O
of O
fatal_cases O

their O
reporting O

the O

number O

indicate O
that O

hence O
, O
the O
numbers O
, O
e.g O

in O
guangdong O
with O

, O
might O
be O

because O

testing O

have O
been O

so O
that O

this O
is O
unlikely O
at O

caused O
by O

hence O
, O
the O

it O
has O

two O
key O

, O
china O

rapid O

efficient O
capacity O
to O

investigate O
a O
newly_emerging O

our O

, O

, O
chinese O

this O
disease O
as O
a O
new O

, O
discovered O
the O

as O
the O
cause O
, O
and O
reported O
its O
genetic O
sequence O
to O
the O
world O
in O
less O
than O
14 O
days O

at O
the O
time O
of O
writing O
, O
we O
have O
detailed O
information O
on O
its O
relationship O
to O
other O
bat B-WILDLIFE
coronaviruses O
, O
many O
of O
which O
were O
discovered O
in O
a O
collaboration O
among O

, O

, O
on O
the O
clinical O
findings O
, O
the O
epidemiology O
of O
viral O
transmission O
, O
and O
on O
its O
spread O
to O
other O
countries O

these O
rapid O
and O
successful O
results O
are O
a O
resounding O
endorsement O
of O
china O
's O
emergence O
as O
a O
21st_century O
scientific O
superpower O
, O
and O
of O
a O
country O
with O
a O
modern O

, O
technically O
supported O
by O
the O

a O
system O
of O
provincial O
and O
city O
cdcs O
that O
are O
trained O
in O
effective O
outbreak_investigation O
and O

however O
, O
despite O
these O
efforts O
, O
this O
novel O
virus O
was O
able O
to O
spread O
via O
infected O
people O
traveling O
within O
china O
and O
internationally O

furthermore O
, O
the O
mechanism O
of O
spillover O
that O
led O
to O
human O
infection B-COVID
is O
still O
uncertain O
, O
although O
it O
has O
all O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
a O
bat-origin O
sars-related O
coronavirus B-COVID
( O
sarsr-cov O
) O

this O
leads O
us O
to O
two O
questions O
that O
we O
need O
to O
think O
⁎ O
corresponding O
author O

through O
even O
now O
to O
get O
ready O
to O
prevent O
the O
next O
2019-ncov-like O
pandemic O
: O
the O
first O
question O
is O
why O
did O
this O
virus O
spread O
so O
rapidly O
, O
and O
how O
can O
we O
deal O
with O
this O
risk O

china O
has O
changed O
significantly O
since O
the O
emergence O
of O
sars O
in O
2002 O
- O
2003 O

the O
economy O
has O
expanded O
, O
and O
many O
people O
have O
become O
wealthier O
, O
leading O
to O
an O
expansion O
of O
air O
and O
high-speed_train O
travel O

it O
is O
estimated O
that O
3 O
billion O
individual O
journeys O
were O
planned O
during O
the O
lunar O
new O
year O
holiday O
( O
chunyun O
) O
, O
around O
80 O
million O
of O
these O
being O
flights O

the O
flight O
habits O
of O
chinese O
citizens O
have O
changed O
alsowith O
many O
more O
flying O
internationally O
for O
business O
or O
tourism O

in O
addition O
, O
since O
2003 O
, O
there O
has O
been O
an O
increase O
in O
travel O
between O
china O
and O
african_countries O
, O
across O
southeast_asia O
and O
into O
the O
new O
world O
as O
part O
of O
china O
's O
expansion O
of O
business O
and O
trade O

this O
largely O
explains O
why O
the O
virus O
was O
able O
to O
spread O
out O
of O
china O
much O
more O
rapidly O
than O
sars-cov B-COVID
, O
which O
took O
over O
2 O
months O
to O
move O
to O
hong_kong O
then O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O

the O
second O
question O
is O
what O
is O
the O
source O
of O
this O
virus O

the O
evidence O
is O
fairly O
clear O
: O
most O
of O
the O
initial O
cases O
were O
linked O
to O
a O
seafood O
market O
that O
also O
sold O
butchered O
livestock B-LIVESTOCK
meat O
and O
some O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE

the O
virus O
itself O
appears O
to O
have O
a O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
( O
bat B-WILDLIFE
) O
origin O
similar O
to O
sars-cov B-COVID
, O
which O
also O
emerged O
in O
a O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
market O
through O
the O
interactions O
of O
humans O
and O
other O
animals O
that O
acted O
as O
the O
intermediate_hosts O
of O
the O
virus O

with O
two O
disease O
outbreaks O
originating O
in O
china O
significantly O
linked O
to O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
markets O
, O
this O
is O
an O
obvious O
target O
for O
control O
programs O
to O
prevent O
future O
epedemics O
and O
pandemics O

indeed O
, O
there O
have O
already O
been O
calls O
from O
chinese O
conservationists O
, O
public_health O
leaders O
and O
policy_makers O
to O
reduce O
the O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
consumption O

however O
, O
banning O
or O
even O
reducing O
the O
sale O
of O
wild O
game O
may O
not O
be O
straightforward O
and O
it O
is O
challenging O
to O
change O
behaviors O
that O
are O
influenced O
by O
chinese_culture O
and O
traditions O

in O
addition O
to O
a O
strong O
belief O
in O
the O
purported O
curative O
power O
of O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
and O
their O
by-products O
, O
the O
consumption O
of O
the O
rare O
and O
expensive O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
has O
become O
a O
social O
statement O
of O
wealth O
boosted O
by O
economic_growth O

changing O
these O
cultural O
habits O
will O
take O
time O
, O
however O
, O
recent O
behavioral O
questionnaire O
data O
suggests O
a O
generational O
transformation O
with O
reduced O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
consumption O
in O
the O
younger O
generation O

there O
is O
no O
doubt O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
wildlife_trade O
has O
an O
inherent O
risk O
of O
bringing O
people O
close O
to O
pathogens O
that O
wildlife B-WILDLIFE
carry O
, O
that O
we O
have O
not O
yet O
encountered O
, O
and O
that O
have O
the O
potential O
of O
leading O
to O
the O
next O
outbreak O

here O
, O
we O
propose O
three O
key_steps O
to O
helping O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
a O

as O

this O

as O
a O
long-term O
goal O

dealing O
with O
the O
risk O
of O
future O

requires O
a O
global O
effort O

china O
is O
located O
within O
a O
major O
' O
emerging O
disease O
hotspot O
' O
in O
southeast_asia O
, O
but O
there O
is O
also O
a O
high O
risk O
of O
future O
diseases O
originating O
in O
sub-saharan_africa O
, O
south_asia O
and O
latin_america O

furthermore O
, O
the O
drivers O
of O
disease O
emergence O
are O
human O
activities O
that O
are O
expanding O
on O
a O
global O
scale O
, O
including O
deforestation O
, O
agricultural O
intensification O
and O
the O
wildlife_trade O

this O
has O
led O
to O
an O
exponential O
increase O
in O
the O
frequency O
of O
animal-human O
contact O
and O
likelihood O
of O
novel O
disease O
emergence O
and O
spread O
, O
suggesting O
that O
pandemics O
will O
become O
more O
frequent O
and O
more O
devastating O
in O
the O
future O

these O
threats O
face O
all O
countries O
because O
once O
diseases O
emerge O
, O
they O
travel O
rapidly O
and O
freely O
through O
our O
global O
networks O
of O
travel O
and O

we O
look O
forward O
to O
continued O
collaboration O
among O

from O

and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O

to O

actually O
implies O
that O
it O

, O
especially O
to O

without O
much O
knowledge O
of O

the O

is O
also O
not O

with O
the O

covid-19 B-COVID

sars-cov-2 B-COVID
, O
as O
a O
naturally_occurring O

, O
is O

naming O

is O
therefore O
truly O
misleading O

for O
such O
an O
epidemic O
virus O
with O
apparent O
international O
concern O
, O
it O

its O

2019-ncov B-COVID

still O
evolving O
, O
and O
it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
predict O
the O

of O
the O

some O
experts O
predicted O
that O

evolve O
to O
a O
low_pathogenic O

coronavirus B-COVID
, O
which O

if O

perhaps O
even O
around O

world O

people O
develop O
panic O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
a O

of O
sars O

travellers O

might O
not O
want O
to O
visit O
a O
country O
with O
an O
ongoing O
epidemic O
or O
even O

people O
may O
also O
believe O
that O
, O
like O

, O
2019-ncov B-COVID
will O
not O
re-emerge O
once O
the O

they O
might O
not O
be O
prepared O

one O
of O
the O

these O

are O
against O

under O
the O

the O

such O
are O

it O
is O
expected O
that O

continue O
to O
work O
towards O
their O
predominant O
control O
as O
much O
as O
possible O

on O
the O
health O

, O
the O

approach O
is O
being O
upheld O
where O
critical O
information O

as O
that O

in O

to O
the O

these O

because O

it O
is O
the O

that O

, O
a O

on O
this O
, O
the O

part O
is O
that O

the O
foundations O
for O
this O
escalating O
loss O
can O
be O
witnessed O
in O
the O
rapid O
growth O
of O
travel O
bans O
being O
enacted O
by O
some O

their O
international_airports O
, O
especially O

and O
their O
growth O
into O
general O
non-chinese O

on O
this O
, O
noting O
that O
the O
outbreak O
came O
almost O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
lunar O
new O

celebrations O
, O
and O
that O
it O
had O
been O
estimated O
that O
over O
400 O

were O
expected O
to O
travel O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
and O
china O
to O
observe O
this O
festivity O
, O
the O
majority O
have O
had O
to O
reconsider O
their O
options O
as O
to O

, O

due O

those O

, O
this O
move O
has O
already O
affected O
the O

the O
above O
impacts O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
issues O
of O
virus O
outbreaks O
transcend O
urban O
safety O
and O
impacts O
upon O
all O
other O
facets O
of O
our O

therefore O
, O
it O
becomes O
paramount O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
measures O
taken O
to O
contain O
a O
virus O
transcend O
nationalist O
agendas O
where O

is O
normally O

, O
to O
a O
more O
global O
agenda O
where O
humanity O
and O

are O
encouraged O

with O
such O
an O
approach O
, O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
to O
share O
urban O

to O
better O
monitor O
emerging O

in O

thereby O
ensuring O
no O

on O
such O
sectors O
like O

amongst O

this O
is O
possible O
by O
ensuring O
collaborative O
, O
proactive O
measures O
to O

and O
thus O
, O
human O

this O
would O
remove O

, O
that O
has O
been O
seen O
to O
bear O
the O
economic O

this O
can O
be O

by O

limitations O
in O

first O
, O
our O
results O
present O
an O
estimate O
for O
the O

which O
only O
addresses O

more O
precise O
ifr O
estimates O
that O

other O
than O

can O
only O
be O
estimated O
using O
additional O
data O
( O
e.g. O
, O

) O

it O
should O
be O
noted O
that O
not O
only O
the O
denominator O
but O
also O
the O
numerator O
values O
are O
subject O
to O
better O
estimation O
( O
e.g O

excess_mortality O
estimate O
) O

second O
, O
our O
study O
relied O
on O
limited O
empirical_data O
that O

extracted O
from O

thus O
, O
future_studies O
with O
greater O
sample_size O
and O
precision O
are O
needed O

nonetheless O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
this O
study O
will O
improve O
the O

statistical O

not O
greatly O

window O
time O

since O
the O

, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
sum O
of O
the O

the O

can O
be O
a O
plausible O
estimation O
of O

fifth O
, O
heterogeneous O
aspects O

death O
( O

the O

of O

this O
characteristic O

some O

that O
this O
may O
not O
be O
the O
case O

although O
the O
extent O

the O

hosts O
( O
based O

since O
our O
results O

our O

an O
upper O

on O
the O

posed O
by O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID

the O

it O
might O
be O
expected O
that O
the O

decrease O

, O
it O
will O
be O
possible O

another O
possibility O

be O
to O
account O
more O

either O
by O

it O
would O
also O
be O
possible O
to O
differentiate O
between O

in O
the O

on O
the O

a O

a O
higher O

a O

questions O
such O
as O
shown O
below O
are O
key O
questions O
for O
the O
field O
to O
be O
moving O
forward O
: O
1 O

what O
are O
the O
mechanisms O
whereby O
exercise O
affects O
various O
aspects O
of O

system O
omics O
measures O

3 O

does O
exercise O

functioning O
translate O
into O

how O
does O

what O
are O

zhu O
: O
finally O
, O
you O
have O
been O
very O
supportive O
of O
chinese O
scholars O
and O
have O
trained O
some O
excellent O
graduate O
students O
from O

you O
have O
also O
often O
reviewed O
the O
research O
works O
submitted O
from O
chinese O
laboratories O

based O
on O
your O
observation O
and O
experience O
, O
which O
areas O
should O
the O
chinese O
scholars O
and O
laboratories O
further O
improve O
and O
focus O
on O

woods O
: O
yes O
, O
i O
get O
many O
inquiries O
from O
chinese O
and O
other O
international O
students O
about O
potentially O
working O
in O
my O
laboratory O
as O
a O
pre-doctoral O
student O

the O
main O
advice O
that O
i O
would O
give O
these O
students O
is O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
you O
have O
( O
a O
) O
a O
strong O
academic O
record O
that O
includes O
basic O
science O
courses O
( O
i.e. O
, O
chemistry O
, O
physiology O
) O
, O
( O
b O
) O
evidence O
of O
basic O
science O
wet O
laboratory O
skills O
, O
and O
( O
c B-COVID
) O
tangible O
research O
output O
( O
i.e. O
, O
abstracts O
, O
publications O
, O
and O
presentations O
) O
in O
your O
field O

i O
would O
also O
caution O
about O
using O
cold O
call O
e-mails O
that O
do O
not O
reflect O
careful O
thought O
and O
research O
relative O
to O
the O
individual O
you O
are O
contacting O

you O
should O
read O
the O
work O
and O
understand O
the O
research O
interests O
of O
the O
professor O
you O
are O
contacting O
while O
also O
making O
a O
case O
that O
you O
have O
strong O
interests O
and O
skills O
in O
this O
area O

most O
of O
the O
chinese O
scholars O
i O
have O
mentored O
came O
to O
me O
on O
recommendation O
from O
someone O
i O
know O
and O
trust O
( O
e.g. O
, O
another O
u.s O
. O
or O
international O
professor O
or O
student O
) O

thus O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
create O
a O
network O
of O
people O
in O
your O
field O
of O
interest O

you O
can O
do O
this O
by O
interacting O
with O
people O
at O
scientific O
meetings O

if O
that O
is O
not O
an O
option O
due O
to O
cost O
or O
circumstance O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
trying O
to O
find O
any O
connection O
between O
you O
, O
your O
institution O
, O
or O
your O
current O
mentor O
and O
someone O
at O
a O
target O
institution O
of O
study O

as O
for O
manuscripts O
coming O
from O
chinese O
or O
international O
laboratories O
submitted O
to O
english-language O
journals O
, O
my O
recommendation O
would O
be O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O

has O
been O
carefully O
edited O
for O
spelling O
and O
grammar O
relative O
to O
the O

no O
matter O
how O
good O
the O

is O

the O

there O
was O
little O

, O
which O
was O
suggested O
to O
be O
the O
result O

ultimately O
, O
it O

the O

by O

the O

perhaps O
the O
most O
universal O
finding O
of O

is O
the O
role O
of O
social O

the O

further O

when O

5 O
a O
key O
factor O
for O

human-to-human O

is O
the O
ability O
of O
the O
virus O
to O
attach O
to O
human O
cells O

coronaviruses O

8 O
apparently O
, O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
uses O
the O

9 O
an O
efficient O
human-to-human O
transmission O
involves O
multiples O
routes O
of O
transmission O
, O
including O
droplet O
transfer O
, O
direct_contact O
, O
and O
indirect_contact O

a O
limited O

that O

may O
be O
less O
pathogenic O
than O
the O

( O

however O
, O
the O

efficiency O
and O
pandemic O

5 O
a O
rapidly O

number O

2019-ncov-infected O
cases O
suggests O
that O
this O
virus O
may O
be O

effectively O
among O

, O
and O

may O
be O
quite O

1,2,5,6 O
these O
two O
features O
confer O
a O
high O
pandemic O
potential O
to O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
( O
table O

) O

the O
next O
important O
factor O
to O
consider O
for O
the O
2019-ncov B-COVID
outbreak O
is O
our O
ability O
to O
contain O
the O
spread O
of O
this O
new O
virus O

there O
was O
a O
lag O

the O

10 O
consequently O
, O
the O
infection B-COVID
spread O
to O
approximately O
8100 O
people O
in O
29 O
countries O
and O
resulted O
in O
774 O
deaths O

10 O
since O
mild O
illness O
is O
uncommon O
in O
sars O
infection B-COVID

infected_individuals O
are O
easily O
identifiable O
, O

insistence O
that O

A O

a O

Lebed S-PER
managed O

It O

what O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed S-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya S-LOC
as O
Yeltsin S-PER
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O

, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin S-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed S-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov E-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin S-PER
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed S-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow S-LOC
. O

Lebed S-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow S-LOC

who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov S-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed S-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian S-MISC
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens S-MISC
say O
-- O
Russian S-MISC
forces O
. O

Maskhadov S-PER
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed S-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin S-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin S-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya S-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation E-LOC
-- O
something O
Moscow S-LOC
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOC
Caucasus E-LOC
. O

Lebed S-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O

the O

Watts S-PER

the O
cost O
of O

can O
be O
heavy O
once O
the O

into O

. O

" O
I O

often O

the O

tenders O

the O

the O

said O

Despite O
the O
current O
difficulties O
, O
however O
, O
analysts O
were O
convinced O
that O
Cofinec S-ORG
's O
outlook O
was O
strong O
. O

" O
The O
eastern O

offers O
good O

, O
" O
said O
Erdei S-PER

" O

Just O
like O
many O
other O
companies O
on O
the O

, O
Cofinec S-ORG
has O
big O
growth O
opportunities O
. O
" O

" O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
's O
an O
advantage O
for O
Cofinec S-ORG
that O
it O
has O
a O

perhaps O
understands O

better O
, O
" O
Erdei S-PER
added O
. O

" O
Cofinec S-ORG
is O
a O
very O
good O
story O
in O
the O
long-term O
as O
the O

packaging O
consumption O

still O

low O

a O
very O
strong O

be O
expected O
( O
long-term O
) O
, O
" O
Sitanyi S-PER
said O
, O
saying O
that O
several O
recent O
moves O
by O
Cofinec S-ORG
boosted O
its O
position O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
Cofinec S-ORG
had O
acquired O
the O
outstanding O
stake O
in O
its O
Czech S-MISC
folding O
company O
Krpaco B-ORG
a.s. E-ORG
, O
increasing O
its O
ownership O
to O
100 O
percent O
, O
so O
in O
the O
second O
half O
the O
whole O
of O
Krpaco S-ORG
's O
figures O
will O
be O
consolidated O
. O

The O
company O
also O
repaid O
some O
$ O
21 O
million O

debt O
, O
well O
above O
the O
originally O
planned O
$ O
8 O
million O
to O
$ O
9 O
million O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
its O
Polish S-MISC
operation O
began O
with O
some O
six O
weeks O
of O
delay O
due O
to O

much O

only O
45 O

put O
down O

a O

no O

This O
support O
only O
inched O
up O

Support O
for O
Ruutel S-PER

68 O
, O

If O

and I-ORG
Exchange I-ORG
Commission E-ORG
Wednesday O
approved O
rules O
designed O
to O
give O
stock O
market O
investors O
a O
better O
chance O
at O
getting O
the O
best O
price O
available O
for O
their O
orders O
. O

The O
so-called O
order O
handling O
rules O
, O
which O
were O
proposed O
last O
September O
, O
were O
approved O
in O
a O
4-0 O
vote O
. O

The O
new O
rules O
will O
require O
specialists O
at O
stock O
exchanges O
and O
market O
makers O
on O
Nasdaq S-MISC
to O
allow O
customers O
to O
view O
price O
quotes O
from O
other O
electronic O
trading O
systems O
that O
may O
not O
be O
readily O
available O
to O
them O
. O

The O
rules O
will O
also O
require O
that O
customer O
limit O
orders O
be O
displayed O
with O
prices O
better O
than O
those O
available O
in O
quotes O
publicly O
available O
at O
the O
time O
. O

Specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
are O
companies O
or O
individuals O
recognised O
as O
qualified O
to O
maintain O
an O
orderly O
market O
in O
a O
stock O
. O

In O
a O
limit O
order O
, O
investors O
specify O
the O
price O
at O
which O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
buy O
or O
sell O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
a O
market O
order O
executed O
at O
prevailing O
prices O
. O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC S-ORG
Chairman O
Arthur B-PER
Levitt E-PER
. O

The O
SEC S-ORG
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC S-ORG
's O
division O
of O
market O
regulation O
, O
Richard B-PER
Lindsey E-PER
, O
said O
Wall B-LOC
Street E-LOC
firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC S-ORG
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC S-ORG
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O
Nasdaq S-MISC
when O
the O
parent O
of O
the O
Nasdaq S-MISC
market O
, O
the O
National B-ORG
Association I-ORG
of I-ORG
Securities I-ORG
Dealers E-ORG
, O
agreed O
to O
spend O
$ O
100 O
million O
over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O
brokers O
' O
trading O
practices O
. O

The O
SEC S-ORG
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O
prices O
before O
their O
orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O
exchange O
specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
who O
trade O
more O
than O
1 O
percent O
of O
a O
stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq S-MISC
. O

The O
SEC S-ORG
's O
limit O
order O
display O
rule O
will O
mean O
a O
major O
change O
for O
Nasdaq S-MISC
, O
where O
such O
orders O
have O
never O
been O
displayed O
. O

The O

at O
the O
Hamlet B-MISC

" O
I O
realised O
this O

that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O

your O
mind O
into O

, O
I O

22-year-old O
Medvedev S-PER

" O
The O
whole O

I O

" O

For O
Medvedev S-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O

not O
going O
off O

the O

" O
he O
said O

Just O
three O
years O

Medvedev S-PER

one O
of O
the O

with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French B-MISC

and O
winning O
three O

. O

But O
Medvedev S-PER

ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O

The O
Ukrainian S-MISC
finally O
hit O
a O

" O

" O

It O

a O
part O

the O

Dole S-PER
campaign O

said O
the O

was O
telling O

Dole S-PER
also O
said O
he O
opposed O
California B-MISC
Proposition I-MISC
215 E-MISC
which O
, O
if O
approved O
by O
voters O
, O
would O
allow O
the O

. O

Dole S-PER
said O
the O
initiative O
would O
allow O
marijuana O
to O
be O
used O
for O
anything O
from O
a O
headache O

an O
ingrown O

In O
an O

Dole S-PER
said O
three O

that O
illegal O

was O
neither O
a O
Democratic S-MISC

a O

one O
that O
involves O
all O

. O

The O
anti-drug O

is O
a O
theme O
Dole S-PER
feels O
has O
strong O

appeal O
. O

On O
Sunday O
near O

he O
accused O

" O

A O

that O

among O
12-17 O

had O
doubled O
in O
the O

, O
a O

" O

since O
Rubin S-PER

tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O

. O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin S-PER

not O

in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O

Cabinet S-ORG
post O
during O

interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic S-MISC

in O
Chicago S-LOC
this O

Should O
Rubin S-PER
leave O
, O
Wall B-LOC

would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O

with O
him O
. O

Rubin S-PER
's O
predecessor O
at O
the O
Treasury S-ORG
, O
Lloyd B-PER
Bentsen E-PER
, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O
by O
some O
in O
the O
financial O
markets O
who O
thought O
he O
had O
tried O
to O
push O
down O
the O
dollar O
to O
gain O
an O
edge O
in O
trade O
negotiations O
with O
Japan S-LOC
. O

" O
Obviously O
, O
under O
the O
Clinton S-PER
administration O
, O
we O
've O
seen O
two O
distinctively O
different O
dollar O
policies O
, O
" O
said O
Chris B-PER
Widness E-PER
, O
an O
international O
economist O
at O
Chase B-ORG
Securities I-ORG
Inc. E-ORG
" O
Under O
Rubin S-PER
, O
the O
U.S. S-LOC
has O
certainly O
looked O
for O
a O
strong O
dollar O
. O
" O

That O
strategy O
, O
backed O
up O
by O
timely O
instances O
of O
joint O
central O
bank O
intervention O
, O
helped O
the O

Rubin S-PER
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O
dollar O
's O
comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O
expertise O
gained O
in O
26 O
years O
on O

" O
Rubin S-PER
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PER
Faust E-PER
, O
a O
portfolio O

at O
Bailard B-ORG

" O
Anyone O
who O
would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O
fill O

" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury S-ORG
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era S-MISC
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O
financial O

Some O
overseas O

might O
shy O
away O
from O
buying O
U.S. S-LOC

even O
sell O
them O
when O
the O

is O
weakening O
. O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury E-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness S-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan E-PER
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve E-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin S-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury S-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States E-LOC
, O
" O
said O
Widness S-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. S-LOC
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin S-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury S-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin S-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House E-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O

ask O

" O
And O
all O

can O
